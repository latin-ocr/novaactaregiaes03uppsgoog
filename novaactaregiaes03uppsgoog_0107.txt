ANUND and UFAG‚ the two powerful 'Phanes here mentioned,
were doubtless the two Churchwardem, called in the Old—Swedish Pro-

vincial Laws KIRKIU-DROTNA(R) or KIRKIU-WAERIAENDAE(R). The
west-Grotland Law (Scnhr'rssss, p. 104> says:

Twer skulu kirkiu drotna uaera Ι Two shall tlw-Glaurch-drilatens ware (be).

As such, and as both probably large proprietors and zealous
Christians, it would be their wish ‚and duty to stand by their priest and
their church, and see that the tithes (to Bishop, Priest and Parish, or
however else divided) were not kept back. They might therefore well
take an opportunity of placing 011 the Ohurch-door‚ in an alphabet and
a tung understood by all the parishioners‚ the kei-nel of that legal enact-
ment which secured to the clergy their full right of tithe, a right which
had already been gradually introduced into the Swedish folklands. Prof.
K. MAURER (Bucen p. 43) thinks these two landholders may have been
patrons or owners of the church. One, may have so been. Idoubt
whether such foundationship and ownership would have been in 2 hands.

With regard to the 'Act itself, Prof. Bucar: (p. 43) reminds us that
by the Norwegian Elder Eidsiva Church-law (Norges Gamle Love, Ι, 386);
»He who neglects to discharge his tithe for 12 monthS, shall pay 3 marks;
the second year he so refuseS, 6 marks; and the third year, 9 marks.
Then shall the Bishop’s deputy summons him to pay within 5 days3 if
he has not then done 30, 113 1133 forfeited his frith (peace) and all his
property.» Also by the Norse F rosteting Code (Norges Gamle Love Ι, 137>;
«The fourth year, he has lost his srith and his goods.»

I here add Prof. BUGGE's free paraphrase (p. 26>:
