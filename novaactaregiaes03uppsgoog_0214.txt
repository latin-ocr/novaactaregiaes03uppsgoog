2 ‚ G. STEPHENS,

Both these works are described, with short extracts, by,Pros. J.
H. Sermousa in his »Incunabula Artis Typographicae in Svecia», 4‘0, Up-

saliae 1842, pp. 12, 18.
F or the communication of »Dyafwlsens Frastilse» to the general

public, we have to thank the well-known enthusiastic energy of the Swe-
dish Riks-librarian G. E. Kmuumo, by whom it was issued in Photo·
lithographic facsimile in 187 6, first privately, and then as Part 66 of
the valuable publicatione of the Swedish Early Text Society (Svenska
Fornskrift Sallskapet).

I am not aware that this remarkable book has attracted any notice.
Yet it is of high interest, not only in itself as a literary curiosity, the
first appearance of the printed mothertung in Sweden, but also as a
philological monument.

For this first Swedish. appeal to the Swedislz solk thro the newly
in-taken Printing·press could not but be an important event. It was
carried thro by the powerful and enlightened Archbishop of the land,
and the version was by a learned dignitary of his Cathedral. Its object
was the relig-ioue instruction of the people, a duty as needful then as
now, and the lang-uage used to reach the eyes and hearts of Swedes was
of course SWEDISH.

But what is Swedish‘?

The foolish modern talk about the »0110 language» spoken in all
Scandinavia in the oldest time, from »Lapland's border to the Eidem), is
mere wind; and the dictum that this impossible »one language» was
modern Icelandic, is a ridiculons joke. Sweden and Denmark had been
mighty lands, and had the art of writing — their RUNES, more tlzan a
thousand years before Iceland was even discovered, and their many and
ancient dialects stand 011 far older ground than the oldest Icelandic yet
known to us. What the first mioet tunq was that sprang up in Iceland at
its settlement we do not know5 only it must have been larg-ely made up
of West-Norse folk·talks. It was certainly vastly older than and dzfferent
from the language in the oldest written Icelandic (the Homilies, 010),
which is 300 years later than Iceland's colonization, but whose words
and forms are of course iquored in all the »Οτι-3111111310» ¹), -— like as this
Homily-dialect is vastly older than and different from the 150 years

¹) The only man who as yet has used these costly materiale for purposes of
comparative philology is -- the Swede «1011. ER. Rmmsr. I called attention to thie
subject in 1872, in my notice of Prof. Tu. Wlsltn’s edition of the Icelandic Homily·
book in Stockholm. See »Dansk Kirke-tidende)‚ Sept. 8, 1872, 9. 567—576.
