Some numo sronsss. 35

ΟΝ is the antique preposition ΟΝ (AN), with the N still left, thus
not yet O (A).

The place-name LITSIA (or whatever it was in the nominative)
others must clear up. In Jamtland there is a parish called LIT. There
may have been a spot iu Gestrikland called LIT-SIA‚ LI T-SEA, Lake Lit.

We have the formula TO BARG AND HELP on many other
stoneS, and the dative ONTA is common.

All this is on the supposition that we have substantially the true
text, which I believe, and that my arrangement of it is on the whole
correct. The mistakes made by some of the copyists have arisen from
the peculiar interlacing of the mnes, some of which may easily be mis-
taken the one for the other. These staves are the most elegant ever
yet discovered on any ancient runic monument, and show the stone-
cutter to have been a superior artist.
