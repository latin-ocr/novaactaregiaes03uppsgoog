The first book printed in the Swedish language appeared in Stoekholm,
from the press of Johan Smed in 1495. It is in small 4⁸⁰, 26 leaves,
29 lines to the page, in black letter. The only copy known to us (in
the University Library, Upsala) has lost its first leaf ; but we ean give,
from the Colophon, the title:

MESTER„‘¹⁰HANS enasor: BOK
ΑΒΕ DYAFWLSENS FRASTILSE.

Fol. a ij recto begins the Dedication to JACOB ULrsson (Jacobus
Ulfonis) ORNEFo'r, Archbishop of Upsala, by the Translator Eun( N1Ls'soN
(Ericus Nicolai) Canon of Upsala, who tells us that he had undertaken
this work at the express desire of that distinguisht prelate.

The work thus given in a Swedish dress is one of the many trea-

tises written in Latin by the famous JonAmms ΘΕΒΒΟΝ, the pious and
learned Chaneelor of the University of Paris, who died in 1429.

But yet another pamphlet from the same pen and by the same

Swedish hand followed. At the request of the Arehbishop was printed

by Pawel Grijs in Upsala:

ΑΒΕ, MossfflNol
sommus 91111391.Τ LARDOM HWRU
MAN SKAL LARA Do 'HL slli-
LENNA sAmo'rHE'r.

This is also in small 4‘0, 18 leaves, 22 lines to the page. Only
3 copies are known, in the libraries of Upsala, Skokloster and Skara.

The last is the most complete, only a small bit being torn away on
one leaf. Being by the same translator and in the same local land·
speech as the Dyafwlsens Frastilse, l was anxious to study and use this
also. Happily Ι have been able so to do, my learned friend Adjunkt
KARL Toum of Skara having favored me with a eareful transcript by his
own hand, page for page and line for line with the original.
