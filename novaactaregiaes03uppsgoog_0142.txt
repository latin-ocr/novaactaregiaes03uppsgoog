proper.

The testes are one pair, filling the whole body between the 6⁰· and
the 15‘¹¹ segmento.

The ovidae-ts are very minute, situated in the 12²¹* setigerous segment.

The ova-ries are situated in the 10²¹* segment, and attached to the
dissepiment between the 9²¹¹ 82 the 10th segmenta.

The receptacle is wholly confined to the ‚10³¹ setigeroue segnmnt,
