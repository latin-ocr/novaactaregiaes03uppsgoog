within the 7‘¹² segment ¹). The muscular structure of the‘oesophagus is
largely developed and very much contrasting with the intestine proper,
which is furnished with muscles in a much smaller degree.

The intestine proper is divided into two distinct parts: one anterior
beginning in the 10²¹* segment, much broader, covered with minute pig-
mented cells, and one posterior, narrower, nearly devoid of the above
cells. Fig. 5 8: 6. Pl. I. The anterior larger part of the intestine occupies
generally 25 segments in fullgrown specimens. Any large flasklike cells,
covering the alimentary ’canal like those in Phreatotkrix, do not exist in
our present form. The underside of the dissepiment between the 6²¹² ‘81
7⁸¹¹ segments is entirely covered by muscular strata, all uniting in two
large bands, one on each side of the ventral ganglion, and with their
posterior ends attached to the dissepiment and integument between the
72¹³ 81 8²¹· segments. Fig. 5 Pl. I.

. The vascular system of Ocnerodm‘lus differs already at first sight

so considerably from that of any other known Limicolide, that it not
only characterizes the animal, but also places it in an isolated position
in the system. In other genera a separate heart is not differentiated,
but in Ocnerodrilus we find two large and distinct pairs, one 111 1113 8²¹·
and one in the 9²¹² setigerous segment. Both communicate with the
ventral vessel. ’

The forking of the dorsal vessel is however that which character·
izes Ocnerodrilus the most. In all other Limicoles the dorsal vessel is
entire, but in our present genus we find in the 7⁶¹ setigerous segment
two lateral branches besides the main trunk, which is continued towards
the cephalic lobe, all three connected with each other and with the
ventral vessel which is not forked, and forming, especially in the foremost
segments 3 perfect net of anastomosing bloodvessels. Pl.I fig. 8.

The other ·lateral vessels are of two kinds: a, qastric, partly en·
closed in the walls of the alimentary canal, and: b, periqastric, free in
the perigastric cavity of the body.

The former ones are plainly visible 011 1113 intestine, especially
when subjected to some pressure. We find of them two pair in every
segment: One arterior situated just under the dissepiment between the
two segments, and one posterior, in the first anterior quarter of every
