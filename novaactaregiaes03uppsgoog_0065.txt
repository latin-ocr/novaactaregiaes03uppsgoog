Sous numo sromzs. 7

DELSBO, HELSINGLAND.

 

Sava never saw this block, but was in possession of a good draw-
ing, which he communicated to me 17 years ago. This I have had
faosimilied for Vol. 3 of my »Old-Northern Runic Monuments)>‚ and I here
give my text theretO, as it will appear in that work. I introduce it ·
there as bearing the now acknowledged local-dialectic ending -UR in
the gen. sing. feminine. This form was first pointed out byCARL SAvE,
supported with fresh examples by myself, denied or explained away or
called »quite new» by others ; but we now see, by a crowd of instances-
—- my Vol. 3 alone contains 6 additional such in Tunes — that it was
not unusual and was spread (however exceptionally) over a wide sweep
of folkships in Scandinavia. For it was not confined to Sweden. My
oldest specimen is Danish, an »evergangD-stone (bearing Old-Northern as
well as Scandinavian runes) from about the first half. of the 9th century.
The runic examples thus run down from the 9th to the l4th yearhundred.
But this form still lives in the folk-talk of the iland of Gotland.
