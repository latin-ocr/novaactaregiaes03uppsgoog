The dor-sal vessel is not branching; no hearts.

The ventral vessel is forked in the 4²¹² setigerous segment.

The dorsal lateral vessels two pair in every segment: the anterior,
not feathered‚ is gastrio‚ the posterior‚‘ feathered, is perigastric.

The efferent duc-ts enter an atrium, which is an all sides sur-.

rounded by prostate glandS, and opening in the 9²¹¹ setigerous se'gment.
No exterior penis.

The testes one pair, in 13²¹· to 50²¹· segments.

The dor-sal ves-sel is entire as in the preceding genus, and not
furnished with hearts.

The ventral vessel is forked in the 4²¹² setigerous segment.

The dorsal lateral vessels are not feathered, in every segment two ·
pair, of which'the anterior is gastric and the posterior perigastriO.

The efferent due-ts are not grown together, and enter an atrium,
which is on all sides surrounded by prostate glande, and opening in the
9²¹¹ setigerous segment. A large exterior penis.

The testes are three, but not in pair3 one is situated in each of

the segments 7, 9, 11 and 12.

¹) As it therefore is likely, that the worma studied by RA‘ran, anovsn' and

others, and by them referred to the genus Lumbstculus, have really belonged to quite
different, and as Vssnovsxr suggests even new genera, have I here retained all ohar-

acteristies given by Onustus, not withstanding the opinions of later investigators.
