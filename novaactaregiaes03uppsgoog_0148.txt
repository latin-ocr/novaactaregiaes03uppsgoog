largest eggs are always found nearest the upper margin of the organ.
No eggs are ever seen floating in the perivisceral cavity; on the con-
trary they seem , to entre the oviducts immediately after having left
the ovary.

The oviducts are two, one on each side of the ventral nervetrunk
in the 13⁰¹ setigerous segment. Its exterior porus is not situated between
the segments, but in the middle of the segment, close to the two inferior
spines. Fig. 20. The whole organ is considerably larger than that of
any previously known Lambriculide genus, and nearly reaching the size
of the ovaries or testes. Its interior opening is engaged in the disse-
piment between the 11²¹* ἃ 12¹²h segmenta. Their form is somewhat re-
sembling that described by-CLAPAR'EDE as belonging to Stylodricus ¹). I
have frequently found the funnelshaped opening full of matured egge,
which fact clearly showed the function of the organ. ἱ

The receptacle reaches an enormous development and occupies
the whole length between the 16⁰² Sc the‘25fl' segments, or sometimes
even more. It opens in the 16⁰¹ segment, in the same porus as the
efferent ductS, and has the shape of a very long and narrow bag, with
thick walls, in which the cells and cellnuclei are plainly visible. F ig. 4,
11 ἆ 12. The interior lumen of the organ is comparatively narrow,
being broadest in the middle and narrowest at the genital porus. Fig. 3
ἃ 4. The junction of the receptacle and the efferent ducts takes place
at the very opening of the genital porus, neither forming any atrium or
cloaca. Fig. 18.

Of the genus ocum-odricus only one species is known, which Ι here
describe under the name of

’ ocNannarLus occlnEN'rAms n. sp.

Special characteristics the same as those of the genus. The spines
are not forked but? entire, like those of Rhynchelmis‚ and 8 in every

se ment.
g The size of the worm in³ contracte state is about ΞΜ· wide by

20mm· long. In extended state the worm is longer and narrower in pro·
portion. The colour is that of rawmeat, and the worm presents the
general appearanae of a small LuvnbriculuS, as A. tenuis or allied species. ·
Its motions are extremely slow, and quite the contrary to those of Lum-
