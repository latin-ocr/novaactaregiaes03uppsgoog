This is No. 1057 in lessonnn, who had no other authority than
No, 1094 in Bautil. Nor has the stone been publisht since, so far as
I know, We must therefore be thankful for what Prof. SAvss (Note-book
p. 22) has given ue, under date 10 Sept. 1851. It is only a pencil note
of the ramae, no drawing or reading or translation or comparison with
Bautil. His runes are:

This is at all events better than the woodoutin Gonmsson's Bautil.

HERut-:Lm's map of Gestrikland has a place called HALSBO·
There may have been a HALS-H1b‚ or some other spot ending in

We have many instances on runio stones of the deceast having
owned or purchast lauded property, well-known villages or estateS.
