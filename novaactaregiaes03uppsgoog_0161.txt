ΟΕ· Two RATIONAL INTEGRAL FUNCTIONS OF ιτ. 5

we have to write them thus

ff-‘(b0ae‘÷...÷b„) = -(b„÷1x'¹·'*¹÷···-!-. b..)‚

in order to form the equations required in CAUcHY's method of elimina·
tion (See, for instance, M. Doswon, E'le'ments de la lee'orie des De'termi-
παηῖε, pag. 118), then to divide, one by another, these last-written

and finally to clear of fractione and to transpose all the terms to the left.

dently is the very function fr(oe), such as it is written in (6) cleared of
superfluous terms.

VI. As to the method now given we make the following re-

marks, viz.

l⁸‘ly Every time the Rule in IV is applied, it gives two new sunc-
tions, both of lower degree than the next foregoing ones, and

2⁰⁶¹5 It does not require any division, because that in V can be
replaced by multiplication and subtraction.
