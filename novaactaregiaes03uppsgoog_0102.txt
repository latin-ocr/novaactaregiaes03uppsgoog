TUO, and he gete his verb by supposing an understood One shall pay —
an idiom too hard and harsh to be approved.

AT, prep. gov, dat. AT.

FURSTA, d. 8. n. sup. The-FIRST.

LAKI (= LAGI), d. 8. n. LA Y, rate or tax or share or price laid on,
levy, here time-rate, tithiny. This 18 one well-known sense of the word,

been exceptionally used for time, this would be 3 very meagre sense here.
And besideS, I know of no example of this expression (time)⁸ with AT.
There are all (not in the sense of time) with the preposition I. Therefore,

unpaid ratiny, tlze year-'s time-rate not yet sent in. Thus:

One-Oa: T WICE-GILD (worth 2 simple ones) EKE ORES TWO to-STA VE

ATA, 30. pl. m. EIGHT.— STAF A (STAFAK = STAFAVAUK),
