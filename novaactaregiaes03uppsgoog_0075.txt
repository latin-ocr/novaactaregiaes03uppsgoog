»The 1)Ιὸ11 RI UIHA is a puzzle to me3 bISURI as a dat. s, n. Ἰ can-
not accept3 it must then be divided PISU. But what are we to do with
RI UIHA or RIUIHA (hitherto redd incorrectly UISR)?›> ¹). Where SAVE
failed, I may well trip also, Ι therefore propose my ideas with great

diffidence.

bISU 1 take to be THIS, in the dat. or ac. sing. f. But PISU
is else (basso, l’ESSO,· bUISA) dat.. s. nem. Himetto we have no ex-
ample of bISU as dat. or ac. sing. fem. to agree with RI (311)), which
is everywhere feminine²). In our oldest Scando·English monuments, how·
ever, we have vevy many surprising local variatione and confusions in
the case-forms of this pronoun as of others, and fresh »variants)> are
found yearly. They will one day be carefully collected by a student of
facta, not theories. anovls'r (Sv. Spr. Lagar, II, 496) has only glanced
at a very few of them. I therefore think this »illegab form to be no
real difficulty.

Rl 1 look upon as the word RIb(R1D,10e1.HR1D, old-Eng1.HR1D,

time, period, all fem.). Of old, phrases of time, when this term was
employed, were in the dat. or ac. with or without a preposition. bISU
RI would therefore be at this time, then. It is a date. But it helps us
not. For we cannot say when the mystical HIULFIR (or GYLFIR) lived. ’

’ ²) Rl or RIP is another instance, to the many already found on our rum‘c
picces as on our old vellums and in our local talk-5, old and new, of the very fre-
quent slurring of the P, from early ‘times downwards. For a long list of rum'c »assi-
milations», »sostenings›), »vocalizationsn and »elisionem of P see my Old-Northern Runic
Monuments, Vol. 1, p. 39. Ι have since found others.—For examples from Swedish
codices see RYth'ls'r‘s»Svcnska Sprakets Lagar» ll, 299: «P = th can in certain situa-
tions dissolve into H, or disappear altogether», — —- — »P can fall away at the
beginning of a word, inside a word and at its close», with, p. 402, Apheresis; p. 409.
Synkopc3 and p. 422, Apokope. But 1 need not insist further on a thing so well
known. - As for the ymder of RIP„ there may very well have been a local neuter.
There are swarms of these words in olden times in all our dialects with one or two
or three ,qemlers in more or less similar forms, and often words have chanqed their
gender, were once masa, then sem. or neuter, etc. Every day we are finding words in
to us formerly unknown genders. Of this RI may be a new instance. Therefore,
also from this standpoint‚ R1 as neuter, PISU Rl may be perfectly regular and correct.
