ΟΝ THE ANATOMY OF OCNERODRILUS. 5

The sec-condam lateral and dorsal vessels are neither feathered nor
branching3 numerous pairs in every segment, but all perigastric.' ⁴

The efferent duct-s are not grown together, aud enter an atrium,
which is surrounded at the top by numerous prostate glands, No exte-
rior penis'. The opening porus of the ducts is situated in the 9²¹¹ seti-
' gerous segment.

The testes are comparatively small, in 4 pairs: in the 9³¹¹, the lO‘h,
the 11²h ἃ the 12ιιι setigerous segments.

The ovidae-ts are not with certainty found.

The ovaries are bottleshaped, and situated in the lOth setigerous
segment, and attached to the dissepiment between the 9*ιι Sz 10*ιι segments.

The receptacles are in 2 pairs, situated behind the efferent ducts
in the 10²¹¹ ἃ 11⁰¹ segments.

No ‚qlandula albuminzfera.

From the above generic characteristics it can be clearly seen that
the genus Ocnerodrilus takes an entirely isolated place in the family, and
the question may even arise if it should not more properly be arranged
under a separate family or subfamily. This however, as of lesser impor-
tance, will here be left without further consideration, and I will in the
following only more minutely describe its organisation and point out its
most characteristic features.

The alimentary canal differs in many respects greatly from those
of the other genera. The mouth and pharynx are, as usually, situated
in the buccal- and the first setigerous segments. In the third segment
we can trace the commencement of a very muscular oesophagus, conti-
nuing as far back as to the 9²¹² segment. The first five segments of the
oesophagus are each surrounded by a pair of very large, lobed glands,
similar to those in Enclzytraeus, only larger in proportion. The oesopha-
gus is in the 7⁸¹² setigerous segment furnished with two large lateral,
sacklike appendices, of nearly the same structure as the oesophagus it-
self. When the animal is alive both sacks are very much elongated and
pointing towards the head of the worm, but when the animal is dead
and contracted, also they are found to be considerably shortened and
with their free, exterior ends pointing towards the ventral part of the
worm. A similar structure is as far as Ι am aware, not known to exist
in any other Limicolide genus and can therefore be considered as very
characteristic of the genus Ocnerodrilus. Both sacks are entirely enclosed
