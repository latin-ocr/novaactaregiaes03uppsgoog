6 O. Siva Am) G. STEPHENS,

ὅλη) gives (N ote-book p. 7) a small pmcn-drawing, with the words:
»Njurunda vid Nordby (Nolby) d. 7 Aug. 51. Lamnum« No.1072‚ Bautil

No, 1102».

But in 1863 he kindly sent me a new and more carefill pen-and-
ink drawing, which I here Photoxylograph. We see that in 1851 the
let, 5th, 6th and 7th letter in the first word, and the 4th in the third,
were then doubtful; but we must probably read, with Bautil and Luae-
olum, BARKSUAIN‚ SIHFASTR (or SIHUASTR‚ Bautil and Lamum
have SIHUASTR3 either is good, the sound being nearly the same).
Siva distinctly remarkt, in his letter to me, that MARKAIJI was certain.
Thus we get:

BARKSUAIN ω( SIH(U)ASTR ΗΚ FR1P1 RAISTU STAJN 1³leA IFTIR
Eum, FAPUR sm. lx FARPAfflN MARKAPI.

BARKSUAIN EKE (and) SIH(U)AST EKE FRITHI RAJSED STONE

THIS AFIER BUR, FATHER SIN (their). IN (but) FARTHAIHN MARKT
(carad the mnes).

We have here 2 valuable corrections of the reading in Bautil and
humanm. The stone has FAbUR not FAbURP), and MARKAbl not

MARKTI. Whether the nom. of BURI was then and there BUR or BURA⁴

or what, we do not know,

The woodcut in Bautil had been previously used by E. J. Bsonunn
in Prodromus Tractatuum (Stookholm 1726, 4to) p. 46.
