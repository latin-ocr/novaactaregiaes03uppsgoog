Some numo s'roNES. · 43

These staves I now divide and interpret as follows:

1. UKSA, ac. s. m. An Ooe, one Ox.

TUls-KILAN (= TUIS-GILLAN), ac. s. m. TWICE-GILD, full-yrown
and strong), worth 2 common beaats. Thus I here follow BaocMAN, Lum-
Gsnn, anoms'r and Buces, and banish our friend the god TU (TY, TYR),
who appeared here in my first version. Cannot help it. Peace be
with him!

AUK, EKE, and.

AURA, ac. pl. m. ORES, ounces of silver.

TUO, ac. pl. m. TWO. I again must object to Buooss’s fancy of
transliterating the plain rune for O by q (which he makes to be a kind
os nez-sal A). The rune sor A must be given by A, the stave for Ο by
Ο, however we may theorize (often, as here, unfoundedly) as to the
pronunciation of this or any other letter in certain cases. All who like
may accept BUGGE’s theories. I and most others decidedly reject them.
But he has quite simply no right to bolster them up altering the runic
values of any letter.

STAFA, inf. (One shall) STA VE,fi.r as with a stroke of the Judge's
staff, decree, levy as a vnulct, demand as a fine. I take STAFA here to be
the usual· N. I. verb so frequently employed for — to ordain, fix, de-
termine, sentence to any fine or punishment even death itself. As Bucen
truly says, this is perhaps the hardest'word in the whole risting. Ι now
divide STAF AT as STAFAVAT. BUGGE thinks this is inadmissible‚ ae,
in the next place where it occurs, there are 3 points between the F and
the following A. But there are hundreds of examples on our runic pieces
of much greater freedoms than this, so necessary was it to spare space
or hard cutting-labor or both. And, when the mne-stamper came to the
other place

how was he to proceed? lf he had written

it would have been much harsher and more unintelligible. Including the
twice-taken but once cut L in TUISKILAN, there are 8 letters thus
twice redd in the usual runic way on this roundel. The whole sentence
is undoubtedly in the accusative, and I take STAF A to be the govern-
ing verb (with the indefinite man must or one shall understood as the ,
nominative, a construction so. very common in our old tungs). Busan
divides STAF AT F URSTA, and takes STAF to be a hitherto unknown
word meaning a fast (fast as a staff) sum or norm or fine or mutet. STAF,
with him, is therefore a second accusative, in apposition with UKSA -
