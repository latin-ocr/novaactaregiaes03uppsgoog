sents this sound of >lt by GH. In his edition of the Skanedaw, when
describing this runic codex (Lund 1859, 4t0, p. VII), Prof. SCHLYTER says:
»As to the orthography there is nothing remarkable, save that, instead
of G or GH inside and at the end of words, it often uses H. This re·
sults from the ancient pronunciation of many words, which, instead of
the present G-sound, had an aspiration whose nearest representative in
writing was' H. We have traces of this talk not only on runic stones
but also in ancient skinbooks written with our common lettere, such as
the oldest codices of the Westgota Law». That K (G) should get this
sound of H (GH) is a small thing, compared with endless other linguistic
phenomena, among others that H itself sometimes hardens into K and is
written Ρ. Ι will only mention one other instance, that the strong qranite·
roelc p, at the beginninq of a word, has in many instances in certain di·
stricts drifted into H, while in others it has melted away altogether!
Inside and ,sat the end of a word, things' are worse still.

In one word, as in the Skane-law runics its * (H) stands, save
at the beginning of words, for GH, so 1 think has the ψ (Η) on these
Helsing stones, as copied by Cam, Siva, the power of GH, G.

Before, in the absence of SAvr-z’s, Ι add my own attempt to give
the meaning of this Malstad monolith, Ι would say a few wordS.

FRUMUNT, nominative, occurs once later on this stone written
out without any final -R. We are therefore not justified in doubling the
R at the beginning, so as to get the »con-eet» form FRUMUNTR. '

STAINA l’INA, a little after, is a fuller and older shape of the
STIN l>1NA near the eud.

The great difficulty is the line SIULFIR UARl) UM LANTI bISU

R1 UIHA. Not only is it hard to understand, but we cannot even guess
what this SIULFIR (or KIULFIR) has to do with the other persons
mentioned on the stone.

As to SIULFIR. Must we take it as an error on Skvss’s part for
HIULFIR? Prof. Bonan, who examined this monument in 1876, quotes
this word ¹) as »KIULFIR = GYLF1R»‚ On the contrary SAvss, in his
letter to me, took what he redd to be plainly SIULFIR as = SIU-ULFIR,
Icelandic SAE-ULFR.

ΠΜ LANTI bISU RI UIHA Ι would divide as it stands. In
SAvss’s note to me of 27 Dec. 1872, after explaining his discovery that
¹ is S and Φ etc. H, he says that there are several things in this inscrip-
tion which he cannot master. Especially of this passus he observes:
