Some Romo s'ronns. 19

Early and Middle English (W13E, WIE, eto.) and then dies out of the
book-language, now subsisting only as a wulgar» word in the shape of
WIGGER. Tha laelandic form is viel, for in scandinavia tha older
nom. -A ending (also O, AE, eto.) lost the fuller vowel and became I,
while the -N of the weak declension fell away, so that, for instance ⁴
(WIGO), WIGA, gen. WIGAN, became WIGl, gen. WIGA. viarussou
says of this word in his OLEASBY’S Lexioon: »ViGL A, m. a flylzter, only
used as the name of a hound, e. g. Vigi, the dog of king Orava Tamo-
VAson, Fms. i—iii, and so in mod. usage». 'We have several other in-
stanees in the later or Soandinavian runes of this lingering older A-
ending, instead of the later 1¹). In the Old-Nomkem Runio monumenta
as being so much more antique, this A (O, AE, eto.) is the rule.

WIGA, then, literally meant only α Fiylzter‚ a Warrior, a Soldier5
but, like all such words, it o'ould sink in a military population to the
meaning of a Man on the one side, and could rise on the other to that
of Champion, Chief, Commander, etc. Here it is doubtless taken in its
wider sense of WARDEN, GUARDIAN, LORD-LIE UTENAN T, Ζαπάτ-
veit-naman, Landslzofdiny, thus the highest ruler in this folkland, but at
the same time implying that a still higher master existed, — that already
‘Smeden laad a KHVG.

Supposing then SAvs's transcript to be correct, accepting for the
moment his order of the lines, and waiting patiently till my learned
friend Prof. S. Euam: publishes his notes on these stones, ——- I would
propose:

¹) I will only mention one. The I'rlunda-stone‚ Upland, (Lus. 729, DYBEOK,
solio, 1 no, 96), ends with the lines
FU(L)H-F1LA
ΕΑΒ AFLAPI
UTI KRIKUM
ARFA SINUM.
This -F OLK-FELLER (sm-iter of men, conqueror)
FEE (riche-5) ABLED (wan, yained)
OUT many-the-GREEKS (in (ἔνερθε)
to -ARV (heir, son) SIN (his).
The Malatad formula is also in simple suive-rime verse:
smLFlR UARP ΕΜ LANTI
Piso m UIHA.
FlLA is here found for the first time in runics, and is excessively rare. 1 only
know it in the Icel. FELLI, but this is only used as a prefix in compounds, sud-
denly falliny or cominffi as FELLI-SOTT, a sudden sickness. Otherwise the Iceland·

ers said FELLIR, which is exactly the English FELLER. FELLA is unknown in
O.·English, etc.
