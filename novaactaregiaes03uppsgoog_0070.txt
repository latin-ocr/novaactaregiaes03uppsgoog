But he remarkt that the 1 · - W - · 51* n are now nearly gone,
as well as the A *Γ (the last R in ALUIR ΑΚ BRATR), and that the
KUb is perhaps (with dotted Υ ) GUb. He gives no transliteration or
version, but these will of course be:
UIFOSTR LI(T hAKua STAX) PINA ABITIR UTA, FATUR SIA

(either N nasalized and not written, or else 4 ornamentally for 1, these
two forms often interchanging‚ thus = SInA or SIN).

KUP HIALBI SALU HANS! .

UIFosT (= VJFAST) LET HEW sToNE THIS AFTER (in memory os)
UTI, FATHER SIN (his). GOD HELP SO UL HIS!

MARKT (cut) mese-R UNES AL UIR EKE BRAT (= BRANT or BRAND).

Observe the 2 types for A and for N; and the ae. pl. RUNA, as
so often in later ristings‚ thus agreeing with the O. N. Runio examples of
this word without a consonant ending. ’
