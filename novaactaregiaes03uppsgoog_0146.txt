The nervous system resembles more that of Tuszficicloe. The supra-
oesophagialganglion is broad and narrow‚ with both its *margins deeply
emarginated. Fig. 10. The anterior one emits two pair of dichotomous
nerve-trunks. A distinct infra-cesophagialganglion‚ as that of Rhynelcelmia¹)
hardly exists, or seems rather replaced by the first ganglionic swelling
of the ventral nerve. The first three ganglionic swellings are much
nearer together than the succeeding oues, and the lateral nerves of the
first two ganglia running more obliquely, than those of the others, which
are nearly rectangular with the ventral trunk. The first two ganglia
emit only two pair of nerves each, but all the other ganglia emit three
pair. Of those the first two are situated near the middle of the ganglion
and are much closer together, than to the third one, which is situated
near the posterior dissepiment of the segment. Fig. 10. Pl. II.

As in the other genera of Lumbrieulidoe the reproductive organs
are of two kinds:

Male and female.

The male organs consist of:
1. Testes ὣ 2. Efferent ducta, and the female ones of:
3. Ov ανίεε, 4. Oviducts and 5. Receptacles.

In Rhynckelmz's, Pltreatotlzrioe, Luni-briculas and Stylodrilus the testes
reach a voluminous degree of development, often entirely filling the
segments they occupy. In TrichodriluS, Rhynclzelmis and Phreatotkria: they
always occur in pairs, but in Lmnbriculus snd Stylodrilus they are mostly
single and only occasionally the first one is found double ²). In all
the above genera their volumes seem to be more or less variable. In
Oeneo-odraus on the contrary we find always two pair of testes of rather
minute development and constant size. One pair is situated in the 8⁰¹
setigerous segment‚ where it is affixed to the dissepiment between the
8²¹¹ ἃ the 9²¹² segments. The second pair is found in the 102⁵ segment‚
but is affixed to the dissepiment between the 9²¹¹ ὣ 10⁰¹ segments. Thus
'we find the testes affixed to two consecutive dissepiments, but not in
two consecutive segments. The form of the testes is pretty regular and
nearly the same in both segments, and also in the different specimens.

The arrangement of the spermatozoa is the same as that of the
ova; the largest ones being situated nearest to the upper margin of the
lobes. The smallest or least developed spermatozoa·cells resemble ex-
