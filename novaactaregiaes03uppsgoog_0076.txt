But all the difficulty will disappear, if the old drawiugs by the
CELsms family and the new drawing by 01131. SAvss were riqlaet J ¹). Should
the stone really have SIULFIR, as I believe it 1138, we get a simple
and suitable and splendid meaning. For this SIULFIR will then be nom.
sing. maso., meaning SELF, HE-HIMSELF‚ the deoeast chieftain FI-
HIULF I. As all other words, so this for SELF 1138 manifold dialectis

shapes on our runio and other monuments. Excluding those places where
the word is a Proper name, I have 011 my 1111110 11818 — which are not

I therfore regard the [FIHIULFI] . . . . SIULFIR of the Malstad
monolith 38 identical with the [ULFR] . . . . SYULFR HAN of the Lang-

111013 810118.

Β111 we have UIHA left. Sssvss’s happy correction here, from the
formerly-redd UISR, makes the whole plain. This word, so famous and
common in Old-English, is almost unknown in all 1118 011181 Soando-
Gothic tungs. I am not aware 11131 11 1138 ever before been found in
Sweden. In Norway and Denmark it has 3180 probably died out. In
Ioeland it remained‚ but only as the name or epithet of a Dog. Even
what we have of Moeso-Gothic does not show it, 38 little as the O.-Fris.

and the O.·Sax‚ In Ohg. it occurs, but only once and then 111 3 com·

pound, in the old form UUIGO. In England we had WIGA, gen.
WIGAN, with a host of oompounds ending in -WIGA. It lingers on in

of 25 years the frost and snow may have still further damaged the 810118 31 11118 spot,
and 11118 may‚have misled Prof. BUGGE. So much the more, as the differe-nce between

²) As we know, the Scandinavian nom. ending in later but still old times had
many forms. Besides the 1181131· UR (commonly in the Μ88. only ·R) were also -AR.
-ER and ·IR. Of 11118 1381 we have not 3 few 1111110 examples‚ some of thern very
old, 38 11818 011 11118 Malstad stone. See JON Tnonxnnsson: »Um R og U R i nifirlagi
orba og orostofna» (Reykjavik 1863. 8vo).
