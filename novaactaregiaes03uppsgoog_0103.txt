phonologioal school, that if Ι had proposed it, I should have been ex-
eommunicated at once, as Ι have ‘so often been sor many such things,
,now silently »annex'w and admitted and used as true linguistio facte. I
myself have repeatedly pointed out the many floating dialectio soundS,
the frequent slurrings os the Ι), and the 'striking interchanges of A and
I on our monuments.

IF, adV. (BUGGE). IF. This word was onoe, in various forms,
quite common in Old-Soandinavian as in English.

AN, n. S. m. HE, tlze-titlte-rqfuser. Boeo-1⁴: takes the word here as
AN, but makes it equivalent to IN, AEN, yet, still jav'ther. In this ,Ι
cannot follow him. We have this IN, but, yet, in 3 other places on this
Ring‚ aud it is always IN, never AN. Nothing is a more common di-
alectio usage, old and neW, than for H to be added or omitted, and there
are humb-eds of runie and parchment AN for HAN. We have the same
thing reverst in the next word, by BUGGE's own showing, HAFSKAKI
for AFSKAKI. There can be little doubt therefore that this AN is the
frequent AN sor HAN, HE, which the sense also requires,

HAFSKAKI (= AFSKAKI), 3 S. pr. subj. should-OFF-SHAKE,
altoqetlzer shake off, entirely refuso. Busan makes this the word here, but
looks upon it as standing for AF SKAKKI, which he would translate,
twist, make unequal, cut off or away, and thu-s not ‚clive 80 larqely as one ouqht.
I think the word 'quite a different one, and the meaning as demanded

by the context. very much stronger, absolutely refusa, after 3 notiees, 3
¹ warnings, 3 fines sor non-payment. Not to pay fully, thus deduced from
(H)AFSKAKKA, is also terribly forced, and is quite unsupported. But
(H)AF-SKAKA 'to OFF-SHAKE, SHAKE OFF, entirely iynore and yet
rid of, has been a common word and idiom in all our dialeots from the
beginning, and is so still.

RIT, ae. S. m. (So Buees). I had taken it, less eorrectly, as an
adverb. RIGHT, law, the just claim of Holy Churoh.

FURIR, prep. gOV. ao. FORE, beFORE, opposite to, contrary to.
This meaning, a N orwegianism, is another of BUGGE’s »happy inspirations».

SUA (SUAl) = SUAVAb), rel. pron. ao. sing. indecl. (Busan).
SO' ‘'233'' rel. pron. ac. s. indecl. (Bonan). AT, THAT, which. Bomos
parallels this sUA AT, sUAT, sUAb, by bul AT, bm'r, bun).

LIRbIR‚ n. pl. m. (BUGGE). A decisive and admirable identification,

the well known epithet given to the Clergy (O.-E. LAERDE), especially
in Soandinavia. In Old-Swedish, also BOK-LAERDIR MAEN and KLAER-
