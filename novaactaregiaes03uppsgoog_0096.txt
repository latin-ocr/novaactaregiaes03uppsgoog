of the inscription had been smoothed off, to make way for something
neur, and the piece had thus been made into a public monument or 3
kind of mile-stone, as we see by the crown and date and monogram.
This last, says Sava, is that- of Fnsnnut Unum Iussum-annm, owner of
Gysinge and Hadeholm‚ and Lord-lieutenant (Landshofding) in Vester-as
1763. He was born in 1723 and died in 1768. Silvis: has left 110 reading.

The whole inscription has probably been more or less to the
following effect:

( ..... raisti stin bina iiiftir ..... kunu seni, uk ..... > UIFTIR
MObUR SEN11). .
( ..... raised stone this after ..... queem (wife) siu (his), elce . . . . )

AFTER MOTHER SIN( ? Inte).
The grave-stone was therefore raised by a husband to his departed

wife, the Son (or Daughter) joining in this act of piety to his (her)
mother.

Thus I have come to the end os these memorial& They are, 33
we see, only »disjecta membra». But they are such as my old friend

⁶ CARI. Sive left them. Want of health and opportunity prevented a se·

cond visit and more careful drawings and pa'per casts and the final text
and translation and comment, ready for the press. But even so, such as
they are, they are of great value, and are yet another gift by this la-

mented Swedish Scholar towards the right study os his fatherland’s mo· ⁰

numents and solk-talks. I have done the best I could with the scanty
materials at my disposal‚ anxious that they should not entirely perish or
be ignobly overlookt. This my anxiety must plead my excuse for my
inability to do them sull justice. And at least I may hope that these
pages may in some degree, however small, help on the Bane-lore of our
common Northland‚ that our oldest national speech-field in which Onu.
Sava workt so early so long and so well, and 111 which he gained his
well-earned title Σ’>;
