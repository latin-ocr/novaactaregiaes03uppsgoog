1859, he discusses this -IYAS (in Zend etc. shortened to -IS), -ISTA.
In our dialects by the sinking os the S to R, here as in hundreds of
other words and forms, this degree-pair became -ARE, -ER and -ASTE,
-EST, etc. We can follow this R·form even in Latin, in such words as
GRAV-IOR-em for GRAv-IOS-em, etc., while in such New-Persian words
as BEHTERIN, optimam, we have the same double-comparative (TARA,
IYANS) as in our English OF-T-EN. And as we have the Latin IOR
for IOS (Sauscrit IYAnS>‚ so we have in Greek comparatives in ION
(ιον), 88888111 IYANs, in such words as ἐχθίων, ἔχθιστος, αἰσχίων, ἅισχιστος,
81 ἡδῗον-α, ἡδέονε, ἡδίονες, 1118 88888111 SVAD-IYANS-AM, SVAD-IYANS·
AU, SVAD-IYANS-AS‚ Latin SVAV-IOR.

It appears to me therefore that a very old real historical floating
tradition 1188 81 1118 1881 of this Scaudian·English comparative in -AN,
-ON, -— and that Erik Nilsson’s printed examples from 1493—1514 are
a most valuable link between the oldest yet found Swedish parchment
188188888 from about 1350 and the many yet living in Swedish and
Swedo·Finnish folk-talks 18 . 1879.

Α8 8 parallel example of how honest respect sor FAOTS may lead
to most interesting linguistic explanatione, I will add that it was M.
Heyne (Kurze Laut-‘ und Flexions·lehre der altgermanischen Sprach-
stamme, 8“’. Ρ8118111818 1862, p. 323) who, in his sketch of the old
Scando-Gothic tungs, first. pointed out that the West-Frisic form of 1118
pronoun YE, YOU (nom. 888. ace), namely JEMMA (and JEMNA and
JEMMAN) is of high antiquity. He shows it 18 have preserved an
ending extant in Vedic (YU-SME, με, similar to the Vedic A-SME, we),
but dimmed in Sanscrit (YUSEM, YUYAM, Greek UMMES, HUMEIS;
VAYAM, VAEM‚ we, Greek AMMES, ΗΕΜΕΙ8) 8811 extinct in all the
later dialects. As he says, this JE-MMA is undoubtedly, by assimilation
from JE-SMA‚ equal to the Vedic YU-SME. — But, also by the help
of FAOTS, I 888 now add that 18 1118 Μ81188 talk of N. Frisland (see
Bendsen, p. 209) this form for YE, YOU is JAM, JARINGE, JAM3 18
1118 N. Frisic speech of Fohring and Amrum, etc. it is JAM. And it is
this -M which explains the enclitic 2 pets. pl. affix in the verbs, -AM
or -M, for instance HARKI’M hear-ye, LAFT’M ye-lzft. And this again
clears up the form 18 1118 88188 18818 for YOUR, namely JAMMANS‚
which is a regular derivative from JAM. In Sylt (see G. V. Hansen,
Wald Sold'ring Tialen) JAM 18 only left as dat. and ac. YOU. In some
other N. Frisic talks JAM is nom., dat„ ac. for YOU. In the Hvidding
district (see Lyngby, p. 47) we have the rare ΘΜ - 888 JEMMA above
