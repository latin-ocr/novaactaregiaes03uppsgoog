4. CARI, Sive: Note-book p. 23. No drawing. Gives the runes alone,

srnou in 1867. Only the main piece. Agrees with Bona, but the T·
after RISTU was then gone.

For greater clearness, I will parallel these readings:
BURE. RUALTR OK UTR LlTU RISTU S(T)1N lFTR
BAUT. URANR OK UTR LITU RISTU S .........
LILJ. VRATVI OK UTR.L1TU RISTU S ........

We. see that the caresul drawing made ΒΥ Bane and UPPs'rsson
exactly agrees with the very oldest by Bone, as far as it goes, and that

we may consequently depend on Bum: for his copy of the fragment·
which is now lost.

I have therefore had photoxylographt their valuable drawing of
1867, but have added to it the now missing bit, as given ΒΥ Bone. 111
this way we get the following text, which is evidently correct: y

RUALTR ΟΚ UTR LITU RISTU STIN IFTR IRM(. . .) ΟΧ LITSIA,
(fapur sin. Kup biarki o)K IULBI ONTA (bons).

RUALT EKE UTR LET Rlsr (inscribe) mis-slew: AFTER IRM(..-)
ΟΝ (qs, at) LITSIA (father sin (their). God bary (save, bless) EKE HELP OND

(soal) (his)!
We feel that we are here on firm ground. RUALT (= HRUbWALD)

is also found in runics as HRUALTR, RObUALDR, with a gen. RUHALTS
and an ac. ROUILT.

UTR also appears in runics as OTAR‚ UTAR.

RISTU is another proof of the N having fallen away in the infi-
nitive, which has colored (to O, U) the soregoing vowel A (RISTAN‚
RISTU, not yet RISTA).

IRM. . may have been IRMUNT, or some such name.
