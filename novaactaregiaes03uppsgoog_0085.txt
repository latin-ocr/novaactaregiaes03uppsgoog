Some: numo s‘rouss. 27

Of the raiser's name only . . . . IN (witlrthe nom. mark -R) is

here leg-I, should it be ΒΟ, is antique, the N not yet slurred.

THUNAIM (TH for T as so frequently) is (THUNHAIM) ΤΗΝ-τ ὀ
ΗΕΜ or TUNA. There are yet several places so called in Sweden and ’
Norway‚ and there have been more. We cannot¹ know whether there was
one in Helsingland‚ or whether . . . ,IN was settled in Westergotland or
Norway or elsewhere. ’

ΤΙΝΕ, pium-stone, grave-mark, occurs very frequently side by side
with stone. And as we so often have ISTAN, IST1N‚ etc. for STAN,
STIN, etc„ so we as often have ΙΤΑΝ, ΙΤΙΝ, etc. for TAN, ΤΙΝ, etc.
In my Old-Northern Runic monuments I have several examples of this
TAN, TIN, ITAN‚ ITIN, etc.5 and in my forthcoming 3rd volume I have
collected 9 others

(raised). Only . . ..U left. We have many examples of this and
other such verbs, 3 singular past, with the old O· or U-ending.

STHRIAS (= STRIAS> is a mansname I have never seen before.
It seems to be one of the rare epithets ending in AS (ANS). Perhaps, .
with the so common elision of l), it is = STRIb- AS, Baetae· chief.

The Scando· Gothic mansname RUNAR (RUNHARI) has not before
been found in runicS‚ but we have the side-form RUNI with its fem.
RUNA. (Whether we take this RUN in RUNAR to be RUN a rune, or
RUNI (RONE) a Runnie‚ wild-boar‚ makes no difference to the argu-
ment.) The -LFRUNAR apparently points to ALFRUNAR‚ a name not
before met with. I prefer AL-FRUNAR‚ All-smmum, the Ever·frownin9.

AFLA‚ to ABLE‚ yet, occurs more than once before on our runic
stones. Here it is found, for the first time, in reference to the pillaritself.

We have SUNAN-LANT‚ ac. pl. n.‚ on the Maeshowe block‚ Ork-
ney, No, 16.

Thus, if the above be admitted, this ancient epitaph is now nearly
restored to US‚ -- thanks to δᾸνΕέ drawing. But of course I only offer
my restoration — till a better comes.

Should the LINI in the second line be the LINI UN'S SON of
the Malstad monolith‚ then the above (a)LFRUNAR was a brother of
BRISI LINA-SON‚ the father of F IHIULFI. The Tuna stone· will then
be about 60 years older than that- at- Malstad. Most likely this is so,
Both are Christian memorial&
