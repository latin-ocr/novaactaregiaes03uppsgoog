THE FORSA RING
IN HELSINGLAND, SWEDEN.

It is now more than a dozen years ag0, when real Runology was
so young and we were all ‘so inexperienced in this new archaeological-
philological science, that I hastily workt out my short paper ¹) on the υ
Forsa Ring. This remarkable piece, on whose iron surface a dunning
rune-smith has puncht-in 245 staves, Ι had never scen, nor have Ι to
this day. But* it had been examined and carefully copied by Prof. CARI,
Silva, at that time the greatest living Runologist. The only transcript
that could come into competition with his, was that by Annum (1806).
But it is no secret that all the older runic drawings are usually more or
less doubtful, often lamentably incorrect, and the general excellence of
ARENDT's work was then not suspected ²). No authority was at that time
equal to Srvn’s as a workinq runologist, one used to handling real stones
and other runic old-laves, not mere printed copies. I therefore adopted
SAvn’s text. Just so now with Sornus Bucen. He has become an illus-
trious mne-man, and has workt on tlte Riny itself. So Ι now follow him ‘
loyally and blindly, as I then did Silva. And this the more as, in his
treatment and translation, he of course has the advantage os building
on all who have gone before, making use of their good »hitsr and
avoiding their mistakes, as every wise man man does.

Not only has Prof. Busan shown that there were some serious
errors (no fewer than 10) in the copy Ι followed (SAvss's) ⁸), but Ι went
on a false principle, that the Ring was a heatlaen relic. This was the
universal belief then, and misled me'. Bucar-3 has made it clear that this

2) ARENDT’S drawing of the Ring is so good that, as compared with Prof.
Bucon’s, it has only 3 faults.

Ξἲ) Silva could only give some few hours to the Ring, as it hung on the door,
and had then never seen ARENDT’S beautiful copy. BUGGE had the Ring for many
days in his own handS, and was familiar with ARENDT'S drawing.
