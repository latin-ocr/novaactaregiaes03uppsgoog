I here print. He has left no translation, but I add my own, which 13
doubtless such as he himself would have given. He remarks in his
Note-book that the copy was made 2 Sept. 1851, and that the old mill-
dam was then pierced by a canal and the mill moved lower down; but
that· the blook, of hard dark blueish-gray grauite, was then lying among
other stones on the right bank of the 03331 ¹). He gives its height as 6

feet, and its breadth as 2 feet.

I do not think that SNRARIR is »misoutn or a barbarism ²). It
seems to me only one of the many instanoes of »local lip», 3 twist in
the sound, and to be = SNARIR, a mansname signifying The Bold, the
Keen, the Swzjftfflcslziny. On the Laderstad stone, Upland, we have the

, side-form SNARI, and on the Hjelteberga bloek, Upland, the side-form

SNOR1R; while 011 the Lofstad monument, Upland, we meet the fine
mansname SNERIBIARN, the bride-tarnim Bear, ll⁷rin9in9·Bear. This
SNARIR answers to the Ioelandio SNERRIR. Compare the illustrative
lines in the Eyrbyggja Saga, 30: »In 1113 youth he was hard and un-
bending, and was therefore called SNERRIR, and thereafter SNORRI ³).
