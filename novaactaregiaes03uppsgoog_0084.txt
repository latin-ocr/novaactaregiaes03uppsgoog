This is Llnsssonnn's n0. 1067. The above is from SAvn's first
sketoh, in pencil‚ Note—book p. 18, 19. Unhappily‚ I ean find nothing
more among his papers than this outline, dated Sept. 1851. The size
he gives as 10 feet “3 i‘uches greatest height, 10 feet greatest breadth.

Below‚ he gives a strange copy of the staves by DN. «J. Ennium„
16 March 183οε
a. [Punar in buna lit hrista sbain aftir sun sin astria
b. Atla bunar sun lina stin b 111111· af 1111· aban
0. In brusi arbiarnar fabr raunar bina.»

lessssnnu's reading is better:

a. . . . -— . . . stin pina aftin sunu sina pria frulim 1· in . . . -
b. . . . — . . . lf runaR sun Lina stin pina f . . — . . . sum mnan la . . .
e. . . . . ln Brusi Asbiarnau ξ sun fabi ξ runaR pina.

SIWE not having given any key to his drawing, all l ean do is to
communicate what would seem to be the meaning of his runes. These
are, apparent-ly:

a (· .> 1NR 1N Pr N un 1¹1¹ < ........ >U P1N1 AF‘nR SUN six
sPfflAs ( .>

b. ( ..... ) ΡΒυΝΑΒ, suN L(i>NA‚ s'mN PINA AFmR, sum summ.. ..)

υ. [N BRUSI ASBJARNAR ( ...... > RUNAR 1³1 <. .)

When -the old copies were made, the blook had suffered less than
in 1851, when Sava found it a wreck. It is therefore permissible to use
old materials‚ and in this way resoue something of what once stood, at
the same time filling in a word or two by analogy with similar formulas.
We are not sure that each such added word was exaotly so, but they
are useful and can do no barm. Trusting then to the older drawings,
but especially to SAVE's, Ι suggest:

a. (. . . .)1NR1N PUNAIM 1T<1n raison P1N1 AFTIR sUN slN sPRIAs

(. . . .
b. (izuk at a)LFRUNAR‚ SUN L(i)NA‚ STIN PlevAFLlRss SUM SUNAN
(LAnts tu).

e. IN BRUSI AsmARNAR SUN ΕᾼΡΙ RUNAR Pl (ist-sa, ’.Ρ-ιω).

This would seem to signify:
a. (. ).ΙΝ ΙΝ ΤΗΠΝΑΙΜ ΤΙΝΕ (mark, pillar raise)D THIS AFTER

SON SIN (his) STHRIAS (. ..)

b. (and to a)LFRUNAR, SON of· -LINL STONE THIS ABLES (yet-9, pro·
eures, raises), SUM (who) in-the-SOUTHERN-LAND (out south) (died).-

c. IN (but) BRUSI ASBIARNSON FAWED (car-ved) RUNES THESE.
