SA (he) WAS DEAD (died or fell) IN the-LIT H (ticet, army, armament)
THEN As (when) KNUT (ε οΑΝΠΤΕ) SOUGHT (invaded) ENGLAND.

There is a third example on the Sastad block, Upland (Dybeck,
8v0,N0. 95; folio, II, N0.19>: IS SUTI IURSALIR, AS (who) SO UGHT
(visited) JERUSALEM. ι

Sive has unhappily left no version, at least as far as I know’.
Most of the words are plain enough. Some are so much the harder.
The order of the lines.we shall never know. Probably SAvs's is as good
as any other. We can at once read K instead of H, if we follow Busan.

With regard to this last question, it seems to me that SAvss's
transliteration is more exact than BusGE’S. 1 know nothing of the rea-
sons which led Silva to fix upon H as the value of the mark. Nor can
1 anticipate the arguments which will be brought forward by BUGGF. for
his K. But in my eyes all these Helsing runes are simply »short—hand»,
a salient part of the stave being taken to repressent the whole. All the
other letters show this. Why should the K be an exception? The Ι in
γ is no distinctive mark, and is besides used in these Helsing-mnes
for itself, the vowel Ι (I). It is the ³ which gives Ρ its character. Should
K therefore ever be found among these »short-hand» signs, it will pro-
bably be as A or something like it.. But to say that ψ and ἰ and ss,
(3 variationS, the ‘one a· little simplet than the other, of the same type, ψ)
can represent Ρ, ——is to me too hard. If the K-sign had been Ὺ, there
might have been some bare possibility, by cutting off the foot and length-

ening it instead upward (from Ὗ to Φ· and then to ψ). There would
at all events have been the V somewhere. But Ὺ is not the rune for K,

it stands for M. ,
Consequently ἰ seems to me quite clearly short for ἕ, which is
itself short for *, which is H. Ι therefore look upon *lv as H, not K.
In late middle-aye Scandinavian stave-rows made to imitate the

ISJatin alpclliaibet,04 (as short for φ) is H; but ι, Φ (as avariation of ιν
) is use or .

And in fact H occurs very frequently (in both runic and Roman
letters) with a strong guttural power, neither so bare as G nor so sharp ⁰
as K. It is this local dialectic sound of H, which I believe to be here
given on these Helsing stones. Runic H has frequently been transliter·
ated as GH or GH. The wellknown Runic MS. of the Skane-law has
crowds of this ³1< for GH, in addition to the common runes for G and K,
