This stone is of course unintelligible in Limaeam< (No. 1683),
whose only authority is the barbarously copied fragment in the »Delsboa
illustrata» of K. N. LENAEUs (Stockholm 1764, 8vo., p. 179). In 1844, how-
ever, the Rector of Delst, now Bishop, the Rev, L. Lamum, found
in the churchyard another piece of the same slab, and in 1847 forwarded
a good drawing of both pieces to Prof. O. Sive, who favored me with a
faesimile in 1860. Ι could not then make it out, as little as Siva himself.
The large lower piece was the one given by LENAEUs3 the bit fitting in
on the top was the fragment happily recovered by Lamnum«.

I now fancy I have solved the mystery, and give the tracing
Heliotyped by Palem.

I think that the whole will be clear, and that the still missing
letters may be reasonably supplied, if we take the RUlJUR to be yet
another instance of a feminine in the genitive with the frequent local
archaistic -UR ending.

Ae, from the bend, we cau see that the rune-lines have not gone
high at the top, only a couple of letter's are wanting there. The first
word was therefore almost certainly the common mansname ANUNTR.
By the peculiar position of bINI on the left below, only a few stares
can want at that end. And as the break there is selamim), there is about
1 character fewer in the last left line. Thus, say, 4 on the extreme
right, 4 (ort and 3) in the inner right line, 2 or 3 (ort and 1 or 2) on
the outward left line. The carver began this last left line with letters
to be redd from below, as we see in the still left . . Abl. The phrase
HAN KARbI is a standing runic formula, and for KARbI or KIARl>1
we not unfrequently find KAb1 or KIAbI, with the well-known slurring
of the R. Still more likely, the verb was F Abl, FA WED, qot ready.

But the stone-smith soon found this reading from below inconvenient,
· and placed the remaining words in the left line s0, as to be redd from
tlze top clownwards, like all the rest of tlte inscription.

I therefore believe that we cannot go very far wrong, if we divide
and read:
