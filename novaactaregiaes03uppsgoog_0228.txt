The above rapid glance over 100 years shows, in Sweden as every-

< where else in olden times, that 3 century does great things, but not

over-much. A large share of the book-language remains stationary.
Some old forms stand side by side with the new· Other things take 3
sudden leap to »modernn forms, and these are sometimes in fact very
old. As usual, outland words and idioms come in. Every writer 3130,
33 in all times and countries, largely influences the word-flow by his
own constructione and the many words he himself makes, some of which
remain. Then from the conflux of all kinds of people to the prese, we
have stores of provincial forms and sounds and vocables. In this way
we follow the development, till the centralizing and unifying influenccs
become more and more organized and powerful.

After this out-look we may now take up the Djefvulens Friistelse,
and Erik Nilsson's supplement thereto‚ the Ars Moriendi‚ which 130313-
times also use, naming it B when necessary.

In this first Swedish book the contractioris are few and simple; 3
dash over a letter means m, n, or e; z marks th, t, dh. es or s; 3 and
ὃ are here first given by' a 33(1 ο; 3 is not matht, only now and then
by aa, but aa does not therefore mean 3, for we have such things 33
far and saar, which is not fair, and skal and skaal, which is not 3331.
Misprints in both Nilsson's booklings are very few. His Foreword to the
