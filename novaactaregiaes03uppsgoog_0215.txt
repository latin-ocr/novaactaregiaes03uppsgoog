younyer polisht and orthodox but intricate and artificial and difficult man-
darin-dialect of the »classicaln Icelandic in the uzu century. This again

is unlike modern living Icelandic in many important particulare, besides ·

which even in Iceland we have distinct local dialects, notwithstanding
the smallness of the population.

I have again and again protested against the modern German me-
chanical school, which handles all ancient speech after the fashion of
living »languages)>. Now we certainly have a »language›>‚ —- a sham and
convention, a gradually growing artificia] »book-dialect» which we agree
to use, and which, thanks to our tremendous Centralization and to the
Press and Railways and Folk·schools and Cultus-ministers and Policemen,
is rapidly killing all the old local tungs. But in olden times it was not
sc. There has indeed always been the conventional talk.of the Ohief
or King and his Chancery, and of the Priests and the Cloister, even
from Egypt and Babylon downward, largely determined by the province
where the ruling power was throned. But there was not, and could not
be, that centralized official iron uniformity in all the many folle-lande
which we now call the Book-language. The great folk·land tungs were
then living mightily, and sometimes suddenly rose up as state-dialects,
when violent changes took place or the political capital or victorious
elan-seat was flitted from one speech-land to another. Thus they might
at any time re-appear, simply or mixt, when the official dialect was broken
or interrupted. We will take a patent and documented example, the
changes in Enylisk (the usual Book-English) after the fall of that dialect,
the Mercian or West-south-English, thro the Norman invasion. During

“ a very long period· England after tlte Conquest had in reality no Book-

lanquaye, only MsS. in Shiretalks.

In fact so firmly fixt were the dialects in all Europe, thatin some
countries (such as Germany, Italy, France, Spain etc.) they are still enor-
mously powerful. As might be expected, even the Printing-press did
not annihilante them. Many, more or lese, wrote and printed as they had
been accustomed to talk. Accordingly our oldest European printed books,
down to the ΓΡ11 century and later, are a mine of wealth for speech-
lore all Europe over. In Scandinavia this hoard bas as yet been scarce-
ly toucht. But the philologer may dig out most valuable material,
things old and neW, provincial peculiarities, even things written in distinct
dialects, and varying words and constructione and genders etc. without
end — if he will study old printed flysheets and songs and satires and
grave-verses and marriage-lays and psalms and sermons and medical
