After these examples we may go to the general remarks in Freu-
deuthal's »Ueber den Narpesdialect» <8'⁰. Helsingsors 1878), p. 141—3;

— that comparat-ivea are in -ER or -AN, superlatives in -ST or -AST.
Some adjectives have double shapes, like ILAK (= elak, bad), lLAKAN

and »vanu GAMBAL, GAMBLAN and »aldem 801), 80111111 aad
11113181». Comparatives of direction end in -AN, as QlSTRAN, VASTRAN‚
more-east, more-west. We have also such from Prepositions, like OVRAN,
QWRAST, UNDRAN, UNDRAST. Weak or regular comparatives are in
-AN3 as FLiTI, busy, FLiTIAN‚ flitiast3 FRISK, fresh, FRiSKAN, friskast;
NY, neW, NYAN, nyast.

Freudenthal adds, that these endings are found in most of the
Swedish moles (dialects) in the south of the Finnish province of Vasa,
tho the most southerly of all, that of Lappfjard, has comp. in -AR 1101

-ΑΝ, as FRisKAR, NYAR.
The Vesterbotten Swedo-Finnish moles offer the same peculiarity.
Unander tells 118 (Allmogemalet i sodre delen af Vesterbottens 1311, 8”.

Uppsala 1857, p. VII), that comparatives and superlatives are frequently
in -ENE, -Ᾱ8Τ, 38 SMAL, SMALENE‚ smalast3 LETT, LETTENE,

lettast; but also in -ER, -ST, as FAGER, FAGER‚ fagst. — And 80 iu
other parts os the province (See Fr. Widmark‚ Bidrag till kannedom 0111
Vesterbottens Landskapsmal, 8'0. Stockholm 1863, p. 16). Adjectives
in Nysatra often have -ENE in the comp., in Kalix -AN, in Skelleftea
-ANE. So 3180 38 10 AdverbS. For instance in N. Kalix TEID, often,

comp. TEIRAN, sup. TEIREST.
Thus this »illegality›> or »accidental barbarism» 01· modern »pateis-
