segment. Those gastric vessels seem not to be connected with the ven-
tral bloodvessel, but end in or on the walls of the intestine.

Between the large gastric vessels a very minute rectilineal net of
vessels is seen entirely covering the intestine and oesophagus. The
blood itself is yellowish red, pulsating in all dorsal vessels,

Of perigastric vessels are found one pair in each segment, close
to its posterior integument‚ or in the middle of its last quarter. . They
are connected with the ventral vessel, and emit many secondary bran·
ches‚ which partly communicate with each other, partly with the peri-
gastric system of the next segment in front‚ partly also end in the
perigastric cavity. Two of those tertiary branches are considerably
larger than the others, and take their origin near the junction of the
ventral vessel and the main perigastric vessel, and project from there
obliquely toward the front part of the body, and communicate with the
perigastric vessels of the next segment. I have no doubt that those
perigastric vessels are homologous to the two lateral branches in the
7²¹¹ segment, and with the hearts in the 8⁸¹¹ and 9²¹¹ segment-s.

In the 6 anterior segments the perigastric vessels form a perfect ⁶
ring, connecting ,the two main, and the two lateral vessels with each
other. All perigastric vessels emit minute secondary branches, which
spread in the integument of the body, here constituting the dermal
vascular systeme. Fig. 8 Pl. I.

Thus the vascular systeme of Omzerodrz'lus differs considerably
from that of any previously known Limicole‚ but resembles that of Isum-
briculidoe in having gastric vessels which do not communicate with the
ventral main vessel. It also resembles Tubfficidoe in having large puls-
ating hearts.

The segmental organs are present in all setigerous segments ex-
cept in the 13²¹* ἃ 16““. In the former they are replaced by the oviducts,
- and in the latter by the efferent ducts and receptacle, which both open
in the same segment and into the porus. The whole organ resembles ’
more that of a Limnodrilus or Tubzfeoe, than those described as belong-
ing to any genus of Lumbriculidoe. The interior opening is not sur-

. rounded by any large brown glands‚ as is the case in thynolzelmiS, Phrea-
. tothrioe, etc.‚ and the entire duct is devoid of all large translucent cells,

like those found in Rhynclzelmis1) or in certain species of Limnodrilua
The interior opening is situated close to the exterior one, and

the main body of the organ extends far up towards the dorsal part of
the body. Pl. II Fig. 13. ·
