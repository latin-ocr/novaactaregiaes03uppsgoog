actly„ eggcells with a conspicuous nucleus and are found nearest the
dissepiment. Fig. 17. Pl. II.

· The efferent ducts differ from those of other Lumbriculz'de genera
in having no prostate glands, and also in opening in the same segment
and into the same external porus as the receptacle. This porus is si-
tuated as far back as in the 16²¹* segment. Fig 9. Pl. Ι.

In Lambriculus, Stylodrilm, Trichode'lus and Phreatothriae the efferent
ducts are confined to only two seg-ments, in Rhynchelmis they extend
through five ¹) segments, but in Omerodrilus they are found extending
through 8 segments or from the middle of the 16³² to the middle of the
9²¹¹. The lower and larger part of the &gerent ducts seems at first sight
to consist of a single duct, which is divi ed in the 11th segment in two
separate ducts, each one carrying at the end the usual funnelshaped or-
gan. But viewed with a high magnifying power, the apparently single
duct is found to consist of two different ones, which however are closely
grown together, and more so the nearer we approach the exterior op-
ening (Fig. 3). This growing together is however never perfect, as even
close to the external porus the two interior ciliated canals are seen to
be divided or separated by an etremely fine and tender membrane, in
which no cells are visible. Fig. 14 represents a part of the efferent
ducts in the 11th segment, fig. 15 ἃ 16 again parts nearer tc, and close
by the exterior porus in the 16*ιι segment. Fig. 18 represents the porus
of the reproductive organs as seen in optical section, showing the jun-
ction of the efferent duct and the receptacle.

No atrium can be said to exist, as the ciliated epithelium which
always is absent from the atrium, here extends clear down to the lower
end of the genital porus. The said porus is surrounded by several cir-
cular muscles, but no traces of prostate glands can be found.

The first efferent-sunuel is engaged in the dissepiment between
the 9⁰¹ Sc 10²¹· segments and the second or lower one in the dissepiment
between the 10⁰² Sc 11th segments. In all other genera of Lumbrz‘culz'doe
the efferent sunnels are situated nearer to the male porus, and in fact
always, even in Rhynclzelmis, in the segments surrounding the same.

The ovaries are found in the 11*ιι segment attached to the disse-
piment between that and the 12*ιι segment. Their general form is unlike
that of the said organs in Trichodrilus and Phreatotkriae, but resembles
more that of other genera, such as Lambrieulus and Stylodrilua The
