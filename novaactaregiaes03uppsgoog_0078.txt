-- WE SO UGHT (sachi, brouqht) STONE 'THIS NORTH IN BALASTIN.

In the same way as on this Malstad minne, many of our finest
Northern runic death-pillars announce at their close (usually in verse, as
here) some memorable exploit of the deceast‚ or some great rank or
wealth or office which he had gained, ere he was called away from his

kindred and brothers-in-arms.

As Ι have never been iu Helsingland‚ and have no opportunity
of studying its minute‘topographffi 1 do not know where the places here
called 1 bRIM-BIUM, A SIU‚ and 1 BALAsTIN were. only, as to the
first, we stin have similar oomp011nds; thus, TREHORNA in Jcnkcpings
and Ostergotlands Lan, TREHORNING-SJO in West Norrlands Liin3

TREVATTNA in Skaraborgs Lim, TREABOTHE (now TRIABO) in Smin·
land, and several others, With regard to A SIU‚ it must have been a

' common local name in water-rich Norrland.

Ι cannot regard LANAHR as 3 stead-name, but as 3 mansname,
like 311 the others preceded by the well-known IN bA. I observe, how·
ever, that Prof. BUGGE (Forsa·Ringen p. 39) takes this LANAHR to be
the spot now called LONNANGER. I fail to see how LANAHR ever

could produce such 3 form as LONNANGER; still less can 1 believe

that — in such a long pedigree, all connected by the formal IN ΡΑ,
written out or understood — one of the ascending names should sud·
denly become the name of a place. The 3 real place-names are given
with the usual prepositions I (IN) and A (AN, ON).· And beside8‚ we
have the acknowledged runic family names LA and NAH. Why should
we not divide LA-NAHR? The R is merely the nominative-mark. Here
