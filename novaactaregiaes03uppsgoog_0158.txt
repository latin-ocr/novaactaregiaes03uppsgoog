These equations demonstrate evidently the truth of the theorem.

It is of practical use to observe, that the sanction Ψιζφ) is imme-
diately obtained by omittiny in Ψ(.τ) all tlte ter-ms, which involve the m 4- 1
lw‘ylzest powers of α’.

Il. If, when m < n, the theorem just proved is also applicable
to the functions α’(ω) ‚and Ψκω), either the greatest common measure
of the given functions will be found by simply applying the theo-
rem, or one will obtain a new function, such that the greatest com-
mon measure of it and of that of the functions o(oe) and †,(x), which
is of the lower degree, will be the same as the greatest. common mea·
sure of the given functions. Going on in this way applying the
theorem as often as possible, either the greatest common measure of
thc given functions will be found or one must finally obtain two func-
tions not satisfying the conditions of the above theorem, the greatest
common measure of which will also be that of the given functione.

It remains, therefore, only to sheW, how to find the greatest common
measure of two functions, neither of them involvingapower ofoe as factor
and both of which are such, that their coefficients do not satisfy the whole
system os conditions (2) for the applicability of the theorem in I. Moreover,
allowing one of these functione, but not both, to contain a power of ,τ as
factor, we may suppose them to be of the same degree, because, as by
supposition their greatest common measure does not involve any power
of ‚r as factor, it. will remain unaltered, if we multiply the function of
the lower degree bv a suitable power of x.

III. Suppose we have the functions:

of which both do not involve powers of ,v as factore and which at the same
time are such, that not all the coefficients in that, where the index of the last
