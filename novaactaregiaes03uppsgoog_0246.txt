34 G. Smpnans, Tm: Fms'r Boox Pauwrsn IN Swssmsn.

As a specimen of the endless variety of mere spelling, the substan-
tial sound being osten nearly the same, it is sufficient to remark that
the 3 s. pr. of the verb HAFFWA is: haffwer, hafwir‚ hafwer‚ haffwir‚
hawer, haffer, etc.

All the above extracts are given verbatim. The »modificatiom,
»correction)>‚ »regulation)>‚ »restoratiom and »normalisationn of older mo-
numents and documents — is all a falsarium and a swindle. If we will,
we can suggest the »correctn form in a note, sor a writer's or printer's
error is possible. But otherwise such changes destroy every trace os
archaisms and neologisms and local variation andgeneral progress in any
language‚ and are a part of that modern school which by suppression or
creation bolsters up its absurd theories. We want things ως they are,
not as they ouyht to have been in the opinion of pragmatical editors.
Hence all such corrupted reprints are mere wastepaper‚ an insult to the
mother-tu11g‚ and useless as to the facts and phenomena of Compa-
rative Philology -— old or neW.

’ This little paper on a rare »folk-book», one intended for »menige
allmogen» in Sweden‚ is more imperfect than it ought to have been, as
hurriedly written under the pressure of very hard work in many other
directions. And it has no Index. But such as it ie, and with all its
fausta, I hope it may be of some use and interest to all students of the
venerable and beautiful Swedish language in this its unfixt overgang
Fre-Reformation period.
