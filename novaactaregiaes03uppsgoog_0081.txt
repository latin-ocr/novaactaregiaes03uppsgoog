Some Rumc s'ronss. 23

On the same page 116 remarks: »The genealogical order on the
Malstad stone is in the ascending line, but on the Sunna stone it is
descending‚ contrary to the explanation of Amemu- and others; so that
{JURMUNT (not F ROMUNT, as mmmm-:N says) is Brise's son and SUD-
BARIR is F ROMUNT'S son, ete. In one word, F ROMUND has here,
on this block to the memory of his father F IHIOLF, commemorated his
uncle’s stem in descending 111161) ¹).

Icannot see that things were exactly so. We must remember
that the Malstad death-minue, as a stem-roll, stands alone among all our
monuments. We have here a record of 11 generatione, thus going back
some 300 to 400 winters‚ which undoubtedly presupposes not only that
the family was exceptionally careful in keeping up its ancestral tradi·
tions‚ but that it had all along written family archivea, written RUNIC
annals, probably on wooden tablets. Now such a lordly house, anxious
that the names of its members (whether from father to son or from
heir to 11611) should not die, would also wish that this list should be
continued. FRUMUND, when 116 transferred to the hard granite this re-
cord os the greatness and long duration of his line, would not have it
end with himself. He therefore cut a duplicate block, a second but
summary memorial, and desired his aftercomers to add their names
thereto. This was done for 4 generations more, and then, apparently—-
for nothing is‘ stable in this world, the greatest kingdoms, the most il-
lustrious dynasties of Governors Warriors or Sages, come to an end—-
THE F AMILY DIED OUT. ⁴

Should this be so, we get the following remarkable runic stem-
table of 15 generations, running — if we approximately fix the Malstad
monolith at about the year lObO—from about 700 to 1150 after Christ:
