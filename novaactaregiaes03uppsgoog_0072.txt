My materiale here are: Skvss’s first eketch of the runee (in his
Note-book p. 13, with a transliteration in common runes, all dated 2 Sept.
1851>; drawings of both body and side, pieces not finally copied out
for publication; and a careful copy of the side-risting‚ sent to me in a
letter dated 28 Dec. 1872. It is SAvss's body-drawing and my side-draw-
ing which are here photoxylographt. This block is Lamoun’s N0.1065.
Sava says it was 8 feet high.

Besides the above, a separate bit of paper again repeats the com-
mon runeS. But another scrap has Sivss’s readi‘ng written by him in
Roman charactere, and this 1 here give. The order in which the staves
follow each other is that finally adopted by Sava himself, in a letter to

me of 27 Dec. 1872:

Sava has added the following pencil-note: »(U1R) SUTUM == Icel.
So'rTUM, we took, fetcht, brought. Compare: skatt, er Egill hafdi Βόα.
Eg. Saga, 588.» ²).

This remark is quite correct. We have a similar slurring of the
K in this word, on the‘ Fenne-Foss stone, Norway³)‚ which ends:

¹) SAvn's first sketch (Note-book p. 16) gives, quite distinctly‚ FIHIULFI. His
large finisht drawing, here engraved‚ hae only a small portion of the laet 1. This
must have been a clerical error on Ssz's part. He evidently intended to draw

FIHIUssFleiUlR) SUTUM = iel. SOTTUM, vi tog0‚ hemtade, js. skatt», etc.
³) See my paper in Archaeologia,vol. 43: »On Scandinavian Runic Stones which
speak of Knut the Great» (London 1870, 4to) p. 3-8. The fragments taken out of

the chimney in 1875 were given to the Museum, Christiania. Prof. 01.. RYGn favored

me with paper caste, which establisht the general accuracy of the old drawing. But
for TUPIR and LlPN U (with the affixt article, which we had not expected on ao

old a ωορκ) the fragments give TUPR and L11>1 ΡΑ.
