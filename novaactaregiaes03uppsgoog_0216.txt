and economical tracts, and Customs' documents and folk-books and state-
papers and so on. We find interesting things of this sort even in
writings publisht by scholarly authors, such as Olaus Petri, Laurentius
Upsalensis, Petrus Johannis Gothus, Petrus Ionae, N, Balck, Petrus Erici,
Andreas Laurentii, A. J. Tiderus and a host of others. All this is prac-
tical work, very different from the endless theories and hair-splittings
now so fashionable. But it is hard work, and needs many workers. The
fact is, men from all parts of Sweden served the State or the Church,
or were· privately active, using the press, and hence in spite of their
»educationn give us in some degree their local mother-speech, which we
can sometimes identify by the still living dialects.

But in this way our older Swedish »Grammar», as well as »Dic-
tionary», will be largely modified and enricht, and we shall see that the
whole »iron law» system is unnatural and untrue. All speech is always
in a flux. Every book-tung is only a barbarization of what has gone
before, and abounds in exceptional archaisms and exceptional neologisms,
and gradually slides over into new forms, while old words fall away
and new ones come in. The oldest and most »orthodon Sanscrit or
Moeso-Gothic or Greek or Latin or Icelandic are only corruptions of
previous folk-talks, surrounded by dialects ever ready to mix with them
or take their place. In England with its rich succession of Runic and
Roman monuments and documents from the 5‘¹² century downwards‚ we
can follow all this plainly, and study and group the English Nox-thern,
Midland and Southern dialects, which differ so largely from each other
at the same nominal date, some being young in development while old
in years, others conservative and antique in form while young] in age,
but all endlessly running into each other. In Scandinavia all parchment
- remains of real antiquity have perisht. We have nothing left but what
is comparatively modern, NOT Old-scandinavian or even Early-Scandina·
vian, but Middle-Scandinavian from the very earliest vellums (in Iceland)
of about the year 1200 to the 15⁶· century. Hence to parallel the oldest
Old-Enqlish we must fly to the only Old-scandinavian known to us, the
ristings with Old-Northern runes in the Scandian lands3 as parallel to
Early-anuslc‚ something more primitive than the skinbooks, we must
read what is cut in Early-Scandinavian in the later or Scandian runes.
Then we may take up Middle-Enqlish, comparing it with the Middle-
Scandinavian of the parchments left in Scandinavia. Now we know
that the Old-Northem runic inscriptions in Scandinavia as well as the
oldest Scandian are few and short, and have been redd differently by
