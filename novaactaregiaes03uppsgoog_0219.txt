neologisms‚ the language in a stage of fusion and crumbling and slur‚
with distinct provincialisms, some of them old and very⁶ valuable. It
is a little older than the year-imprint‚ for the Preface is dated Feb.
15, 1493.

In the following pages I have confined myself to general peculi-
arities, sufficient for the student to grasp its prevailing character. But,
in illustration, I have thought it useful to prefix some few similar hints
as to the language‚ from a couple other old Swedish printed books,
passing over such well-known things as Gustaf I’s Swedish Bible 1).
We shall then see where we stand.

Riks-librarian Knmfflmc, 8'0. Stockholm 1854). As a specimen I give
the last pageS‚ a remarkable olden religious poem:

»Heel Jesu myn harre kare.

For thy thw weth wal huilkin iak aar,

ι) The Swedish Biblesociety should reprint this in one bandy vol. small 4³⁰,
and without the woodcuts etc, as a mark of thanks and homage to the great king
who gave Sweden its first Bible, and that studente an the world over may master its
linguistio character. The price should be fixt very low. A Glossary should be added.
