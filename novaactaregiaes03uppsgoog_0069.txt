While copying the above for the press‚ Ι have received Prof. S.
BUGGE's valuable paper 011 1118 F orsa Ring in Helsingland¹). At p. 37 fol.
he touches on the Helsing-runes, and announces his discovery that ὲ and
*b are not S, nor ,ι Η, 38 Onon* CELsms the Elder said, but that ² ‚ vir and
Φ 311 3 stand for K (and G). No ,H-mark in these' mnes, he observes, ·
has yet been found.

In this case Olim. SAvs’s H must everywhere be altered to K
and G).
< Prof. Buces adds that ³ (Ρ) 38 1118 sign for K 1138 only once been
seen, and that ltere, on this Hog stone; but tha-t this one instance is a
mistake‚ 3 break in the stone at this spot having misled CELsms. This
confirms SAvss's drawing. He has not, like Csnsms, J in the word KIRbI

(or GIRbI)‚ but Φ, 111118 1118 HIRbL BUGGE’s KIRlJI (or GIRIJI).

Prof. Busan adds also: »On the Hog stone we must read KUb-
NmTR <not IsUbNIUTR 01 ΙΗΗΡΝΙΠΤΒ), AK (not ΑΗ), KUbLAF (not
HUlJLAF)‚ on the 81111113 810118 F IKIULF ISUN (not FISIULFISUNJ3

and in this same way a number of other 811018 1111181 118 corrected in the
earlier readings of the Malstad inscription.»

Prof. Bucen does not explain why we must read KUlJNIUTR, in—
stead of IKUbNIUTR, but I suppose he lookt upon the first stroke as
a flaw or a beginning-mark.

Probably Prof· Siva had communicated to him, 38 118 had to my-
self‚ his idea that the sign formerly taken as S ought to be redd as H.

This pillar is No. 1069 in ernoumv. Ι 8311 find no drawing of
it in Prof. SAvE's papers. But in his annotations or Note-book p. 12
is a pencil copy of the 1111188, and he sent me a revised manscript, ad-

’ ding that the block is 7 feet 6 11181188 high, 2 feet broad at the large

end and 15 inches at the smaller. He made out the runes to be:
