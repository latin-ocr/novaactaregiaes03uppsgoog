The fem hithert0‚ sufficiently known, genera of Lambriculidoe‚ may
conveniently be arranged as follows:

A. The efferent ducts partly grown together, at the base not
surrounded by prostate glands. The efferent ducts and the Receptacle
open in the same porus. No atrium, but heart. The dorsal vessel in
front threebranched. The ventral vessel not forked. — — .

—- — OcnerodriluS.

B. The efferent ducts free, prostata present. The receptacle
opens in a separate porus. The dorsal vessel in front entire, the ventral
forked. Atrium, but no heart.

Ι. The prostate glands surrounding atrium in all sides; the re-
ceptaole in front of the efferent ducts.
l. All secondary vessels feathered‚ no exterior penis:

Lumbi-{culus-
2. Secondary vessels both feathered and not feathered3 no
Peme ’ Rhyncholmis.
3. Secondary vessels not feathered3 an exterior penis:
Stylodrilus.

ΙΙ. The prostate glands surrounding atrium only at the top; the
receptacle is behind the efferent ducts.

4. The dorsal lateral vessels forked. One {³²31st ofssexeptaoles:
reato .

5. The dorsal lateral vessels not forked‚ but entire. Two

pair of receptaoles:
TrichodrssuS.

As far as otgr present knowledge goes the following character-
istics will suffice fully to distinguish the above genera.
