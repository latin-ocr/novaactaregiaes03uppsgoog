The dor-sal ves-sel is weakly pulsating, in the 8*ιι 82 9³¹¹ setigerous
segments furnished with 2 pair of strongly pulsating hearts. In the 7‘¹·
segment it ‚emite two side branches, which continue toward the ce-

Phahc ’11ῗὲξο ventral ves-sel is not forked, but continues toward the buccalic

se ment.
g The seconciary vessels are of two kind: gastric 82 perigastric. The

perigastric ones only connect with the ventral vessel.

The efferent ducts and receptacle open both in-to the same porus
in the 16²¹* segment. No atrium and no prostate glands.

The testes are 2 pairs in 8*ΙΙ 82- 9⁰¹ setigerous segments.

The oviduct is very large, in the 13³¹* segment.

The ovariesv, 1 pair in the ll‘h segment.

The receptacle is enormously large, opening in the 16⁰¹ segment‚

and extending towards the 25⁸¹ segment.
No gland. albuminifera.

The dor-sal vessel not branching, no hearts.

The ventral vessel is forked.

The secondaty lateral vessels two pairs in every segment, both
feathered. The posterior pair is gastric, the anterior perigastric, con-
necting with ventral vessel.

The efferent ducts enter a large atrium, which opens in the 9⁰¹
setigerous segment. The prostate glands are entirely surrounding atrium.

The testes are large and seldom in pair, one is in the 7²¹¹, one in
9²¹· to 12*ιι and one in 12⁰¹ to 16*ιι setigerous segmentS.

The oviduct in the 11⁰¹ segment.

The ovaries in the 9²¹² ,‚ .

The receptacles opens in the 8⁰¹ segment.

 

¹) According to s private communicetion to me by Dr. F. Vsmovsmr, is the
above worm, described by CLAPAREnr. (l. c.), not identicsl with ,Lambriculus of Gnums
end auct. sl. For the former he proposes the neme of Glaparede‘a. The above generic
characteristics are only compiled from thc descriptions by CLAPAREDR.
