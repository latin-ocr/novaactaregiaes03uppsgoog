4) leen the condition-3 (7) exist and the cmpression

does not vanish, every common measure of f(.z·) and f,4¹(„z·> divides both tlte
yiven functione φ(.τ) and mum).

For in this case we get without difficulty
(aubr41-ar÷1bo)<p(·2') = ((10ᾱῖψι 4· · · ··Ι“ ar÷¹>f(·¹²)-aof r÷1(·²³) ν

IV. The foregoing results may be summed up in the following
*practical

Rule. If aob1-a1b0 cloes not canislz, construet the functione scr)

for all ,ιι ξ r, but
ao b,42— a&¹ b„

does not vani-sk, construet f(.zr) and δῙ“,,Η(α;>. In each, case the yreatest common
measure of the two functione thus constructed will also be that of the yiven
functione.

If the two given functione have a common measure involving cc,
the repeated application of this rule and of the theorem in I must ne-
cessarily at last lead to two functione only differing by a constant factor,
and thus the greatest common measure of the two given functione is
evidently found.

V. In order to facilitate the application of the method, we make
the following remark as to the construction of the functione s‚(.v).
Putting
