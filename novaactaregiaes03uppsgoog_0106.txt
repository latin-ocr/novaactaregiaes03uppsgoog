necessary also from the elegant and complicated patterns used, which it
was not in every body’s power to aeeomplish.

And so of this F Abl, one of the many words employed for MADE
and for CUT‚ and which is several times found on things bearing Old-
Northern staves. Usually it. is N. SATI·(s.) or N. N. SATU (pl.) fol-
lowed by N. F Abl. Now we have, as the whole risting, N. FAPI AT N„

where the dear friend was also the runs-cutter. Now we have the full
N. SATI followed by N. FAbI RUNAR bISAR. Sometimes it plainly

means the whole piece‚ rames and all, as on the Chureh-door at Vafver-

sunda, East Gotland, ASMUNTER F Abl TYR bASAR, and ‚Jattendah Hel-

singland, where N. N. SATU but N.FA1>1 STIN bINA. Pieees with the

Old-Northern staves are still more decisive. On the Norse Einang stone,

N. RUNO FAEIHIDO‚ it means inscribed,- as it does on the English
Alnmouth stone, F EGDE contrasted wit-h WORHTE; while on the Ruth-
well Cross it means (ME F AUOEbO) compo-sed the poem there cut. But

on Braoteates 49 and 49 b, F IHAEDU‚ it signifies made this pieee and
stampt these runeS, as it does on Bracteate 89, FAEAEIJAE. On the Norse

Charnay Broooh it meane, FYbAEI, made and inscribed, as it does on the
English Osthofen Fibula, F UbE. So on non-runio pieees. On the English

St. Edmund’s Ooin, N. Ml F IET, it is coined and smmpt, while on the Eng-
lish palimpsest block at Lineoln it, F IET, signifies the enlarqiny of the
Steeple (EIRTIGN) of the Churoh. — Thus I see no reason for altering
my opinion, that FAbI here means: FAWED (made this Ring and stampt

these rane-s). Thus:
IN (but) UIBJURN ΕΑ WED.

The whole then will be, in freer and model-nized language:
