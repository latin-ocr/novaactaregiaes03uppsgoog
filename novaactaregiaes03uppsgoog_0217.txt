every translator. Still all must now admit that they are N OT in »Ice-
landic» or anything like it, but in local dialects whose general character
ayrees with all the other oldest known Scando-Gothic tungs. The Passive,
the Post-article, and such, are as yet absent in Scandinavia, and first
beyin to develop themselves after the time when Iceland was colonized.
Neither did they exist in the dialects taken by the immense Wiking·
colonies to England in the 9⁰² and 10⁰¹ centuries, and consequently no
trace of such has ever been found in England.

Generally speaking, as Iceland was Scandinavia’s (especially Nor-
way's) 2¹²⁶ great colony, so was England all Scandia's first great colony,
and no monuments and dialects in all Europe are so costly in illustra-
tion of the rapid modernisation of the Scandian talks as those of the
similarly developt old Northumbrian, Old-North-English. Comparing O.
Southern with O. Midland English, and these again with O. North-Eng-
lish, we see as in a glass the processes which the Ο. Scandian dia-
lects have gone thro ¹).

Thus in this whole science, as in every other, we want facte, not
theories, facts first, theories and paradigma afterwards, A great begin·
ning has been made by the illustrious Swedish speech-lorist JOHAN ΕΒΗ(
RYDQvls‘r, whose name shall never die. But he could not do everything.
No one man can do more than offer his whole life in hard work. We
others must follow after, and do what we can, however little.

¹) Ι beg to point out to Scandinavian studente the invaluable 4 volumes of the
4 Gospels, in Old-South-English (2 texts) and Old-North-English (2 versione), chiefly
from the 10ιιι century, printed synoptically by the University of Cambridge. Vol. 1
was commenced by Mr. Knunnm Vols 2, 3, 4 are admirably edited by Prof. SKBAT,
4‘0, Cambridge, 1858-1878. Such a treasure for real »comparative philology» exista
in no other European tung. ln the O. N. E. versions the lnfin. (now and then -AN)
is already almost always in -A (occasionally -E), while in the South it is still (and
for nearly 300 years after) in -AN, later in -EN. And so of hundreds of such lin-
guistic phenomena. — Add to the above the precious »Rituale Ecclesiae Dunelmensis»
[Durham, in North England], publisht by the Surtees Society‚ London 1840, 8¹⁷⁰.
This codex, from the beginning of the 9⁰· century, contains an interlinear gloss in
Old-North-Enghsh, in a dialect nearly akin to that of the Lindisfarne Gospels, and
written in about the last quarter of the 10⁰² year-hundred. — Another priceless work
is the »AngloeSaxon and Early English Psalter», printed by the Surtees Society‚ Lon-
don, 8¹⁰, 2 vols. 1843, 1847. The Latin skinbook is from the 8fl² century, the Old-
North-Engl. interlinear gloss from about the year 900, and is more Southern in its
character than the preceding. The Metrical version, in Middle-North-English, is from
about 1315.
