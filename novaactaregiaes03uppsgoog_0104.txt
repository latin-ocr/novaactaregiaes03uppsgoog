KAER. Thus the LEAR N,ED the Priests, Ecclesiastics, Holy Clzurelz, in
contrast to LAY ΜΕΝ, L’EWD MEN.

AKU(= Asu, AGHU, AEGHU), 3 pl. pres. (Prof. OL. Rmn and.
S. BUGGE). OWE, own, lz.,1ve pos-3688, riqlttly enjoy. Icel. EIGU.

AT, prep. gOV. d. (BHG-GE). AT, by, in accordance with.

LIUl’RITI, d. s. m. (Busae rightly adds the last 1). LEDE-RIGH T
Ο. -Ε. LEODRIHT, Folle· riqht, Folle· law, as I pointed out. Busae proves
that the N. -.I LYRITR is the same word, only with the Ῐ) elided.

SUA, rel. pr. n. s. m. (Busan). So, aa, which.

UAS, 3 s. pret. (Busae). WAS.

INT, p..p n. s. n. (BUGGE). Carried IN, pro claimed J V the sollc-
πισοί, publicly enacted and announced.

FUR, adv. (Busan). FORE, beFORE. — AUK, as before.

HALKAT, p..p n. s. u. (BUGGE). Η lLLO n ED, set apart, specially
allotted, fiaet. Thus: ·

EKE ALL ofiAGE (his property) IN-it (thet-ein) WORTH-is-to·lie (is lost)
IF HE OFF-SHAKE (should finally refusa) RIGHT (just paynaent) PDRE (a-
yainst) aso-AT (that which) the -LEARNED (tlte Cleryy) OWN (have) AT (by)

LEDE-RIGHT (folle-law), SO (as) WAS INNED (proclainud) FORE (before)
EKE (and) HALLO WED (fixt, solemnly anactea).

We have seen that in this sentence FURIR is taken by BUGGE
himself to be a preposition governing the following SUA. And yet the
two words are separated by a divisional stop or ornament (3); another
proos, to the many we have before, of the frequent insignificance of such
marks in the construction of the language. See what I have said above

about STAFA.

5. IN, but, as before.
MR, n. pl. m. THEY, the persons to be named, those or these

men, namely ANUND and UFAG. We have hundreds of such instances,
variously spelt. Confining ourselves to runie pieoes and to those which

have the ί) and the end· R, we have bAEIR,1›AER, bAIR (the commoneat
form, nearly 100 examples>,1>A1RR,bAR(7 stones),12AUR,1>AUR,bE1R,
lJER, IJIAEIR, bIR (the next commonest form), bOIR. — Prof. Bucen
takes this bAR to be the adverb THERE, and makes it. bear the me-
aning HERE, on this riny.

KIRIJU (= GIRIJU), 3 pl. p. GARED, made; probably here, as so

very often, equivalent to let make, ordered to be made.

SIK, refl. pr. d. pl. For-themselves. Instead of the older SER, SIR.
The reflective pronoun gen. SiN, dat. SER, ae. SIK, died ‚out so early
in England that no example has yet been found. But it doubtless once
existed, as it is known in all the Scando-Gothio languages.
