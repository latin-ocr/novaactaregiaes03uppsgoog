By researches on the method of elimination‚ which has first been
given by Bsszour and developed afterwards by Quom, M. Curm- and
others, I have found the following method to obtain the greatest common
measure of two rational integral functions of at. ·

When the greatest common measure involves a factor of the form
oefl‘, that factor derives from the existence of faetors of the form ,τ’ and
ως in both the given functions. Clearing the given functione of such
factors, the other faetor in their greatest common measure will be the
greatest common measure of the new functions thus obtained. There-
fore it ie evidently sufficient to treat the problem of finding] the yreatest
, common measure of two rational inteyral functione, neither involvinq α power
of τι· as faetor.

Ι. Supposing we have the functione

(1) ····· (φφ.) = 30³³* -1- B1oe⁸’¹ -Ι- B„„ae -Ι- B„

and m < n, we get the theorem:

Φζω) and Ψ(.τ> ean only differ by a constant faetor, zf m = n,- but ffm<m
thei-r yreatest common mea-sure is the same as that of the sanction-s ⁴³(oe) and
