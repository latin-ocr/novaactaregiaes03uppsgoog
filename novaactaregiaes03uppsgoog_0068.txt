10 C. SAvs sm) G. S‘rsrnsss,

He has left no translation, but doubtless understood it as meaning:

IH UTHNIUT THR USON LET WRITE (came) STONE rma, EKE(am1)

BRO W (bridye-this) GARED (made), AFTER (in naenwry os) BROTHER SIN
(hes) ASBIARN EKE AT (to) HUTHLAF.

SAvs, by som accident, wrote ASBIURN, but both his drawings

have ASBIARN. He tells us, on the opposite page (11) of his Note· book,
that Hog Church is ancient and of stone, with a wooden vaulted roof
in the shape of a star. Outside the principal door, in a small wooden
porch, he saw 2 stones formed like breasts, one on each side the dom-¹).
Inside the door was a small wooden cross nailed on the wall. There
was an old font of sandstone (the sandstone cover was destroyed), once

finely ornamented, the figures 00 the basin nearly gone, but 00 the base
dragons and lions were still left. There was an old grain-measure, in-
scribed »PETRvs Onu. 1681.» Η8 8180 saw some parchment documentS, a

thick vellum manuscript, and a book in 4to printed on vellum, unpaged,
as well as a manuscript on paper. These seemed to be excellent codi-

ces2). — Doubtless these costly things have been’long since enquired

into and taken care of. Or have any of them perisht?
Icannot help fancying that the first stroke in this Hog inscri-
ption was only a flaw or a commencing·mark, and that we must read

HUlJNIUTR (if the first rune be H), a name Ι have never seen before,
not IHUbNIUTR‚ which, if it be so, is also found here for the first time.

¹) Perhaps these were the bulb- -shaped stones 80 often found 00 graves, 01 the
class ably described by Baron Ο. Hennam (»»Stenkloten» 08 Ᾰιῑ8ὴὸ381088), with
many illustratione, in »Svenska Fornminnessoreningens Tidskrift» (Stockholm 1875,
8110), 1101. 2, pp. 164—205. Ι believe these stones, however altered and convention-
alised‚ were all originally worshipt as Gods or Fetishes, Phallic Symbola, the Linga
and the Yoni‚ Creation and Preservati0n‚ placed on the tumulus as triumphant em·
blems of Light out of Darkness, Life after Death. See Η. ΒινεΤΤ-ΟΔΒΝΑω »Rough
Notes 00 some Ancient Sculpturings on Roeks inx Kumaon‚ similar to those found on
Monoliths and Roeks in Europe» (Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal‚ 1877,
8vo)‚ and A. WILDER’s edition of VVESTROPP and WAKs’s »Aneient- Symbol Worship.
Influence of the Phallic idea in the Religions of Antiquity» (New-York 1875, 8vo).
