Some nume sToNES. 31

AUF 1³1 may have been, was raised by two ladies‚ the dauylcter and the

dauyhter-in-law of the deceast. As we have elsewhere the mansname .

BLESI, so we have here the womansname BLESA. She raised the
stone-mambae, the lines of standing stones 01 whatever else they were.
But FRITHELF, probably the widow of his already dead 8011, 801 up in
his memory the tall ward or beacon. This last additional markos re-

spect, built up near the grave, is distinctly mentioned in several of these
runic mortuary formulas under the names KASI (Swedish KASE, KAS‚

vardKAsn eta), UARbl (ew. VARD) and UITI (sw. VETTE‚ VETT).
There is therefore nothing surprising in its occurrence here. And as we
have elsewhere the KAN- or KEN- or KIN- or KUN-(KE'N m· KENNING
or markiny or pointing] or memorial) RUNES or STONE, so here we
have the KAN-AN-VART, the KE'N ΟΝ· WARD, the WARD or VARDE
οι· hemon-pile ΟΝ or AN or TO a person. We have several of these old
compounds still left. So for instance the modern A-BUI was once ΟΝ-
BUL the modern A-MINNE was once ΟΝ-ΜΙΝΙ, and 80 011. 111 1110 same
way this antique AN-VART represents what would be a later A-VARDE,

which however I have never seen. ’ ·

I leave it 10 local topographers to determine where OM was.
There are still several places called ΟΜ, ΟΜΝᾹΞ, OMSJO‚ 010. in the
north of Sweden. Perhaps an OM may still be found in Gestrikland.

At the end, as we see, there was no room to spare at the tip of
the worm-tail. Hence the contractione STI for SATI and RUA-R for
RUNA-RAb or RUNA-RIT or RUNA-RITAR‚ etc.‚ all which frequently
occur, sometimes as here, and for2the same reason, shortened.

As to the name of the rune-carver. It was certainly BAEUMARN,
however we may divide or explain it. Most likely it was quite simply
BAEUM-ARN‚ BEMEARN or EAGLE, TREE-EAGLE. Compare 1110 Μ.
Goth. BAGMS, N. Icel. BADMR, O.-Engl. BEAM‚ 02-Sax. BOM, Ohg.
BAUM, BOUM, modern Swedish ΒΟΜ, 010., a word 01100 in full use in
Scandinavian as in other Scando-Gothic dialect8‚ but which gradually
became obsolete in some of them or obtained special meanings‚— which
so often happens in all tungs. We have divers runic names ending in
-ARN. This one I have never seen before.
