As we have runic instances of both HRUbR and RUbR, masc„

HRUbA and RUbA, fem„ -—- nothing being more common than the di·-

alectic absence or presence of the H, — so RUbUR is here the same
as HRUPUR, a womans-name in the qenitive, as we all see from the fol·
lowing HANAR = her, gen. sing. fem. in apposition.

UAR-IU can only be a place-name, added either because her fa·
mily estate was there, or else to distinguish this RUTHA from some
other lady of the same name· The variations of (this word 'for E Y ‚ ile,
iland) AU are manifold in our old dialects, especially in the oblique cases.
We have runic -IU elsewhere as a dat. sing. Where this VAR·EY was I
cannot say. An iland so called is in a channel to Bindalsfjord and F ol-
den, in Naumdal, Norway. This, by marriage and removal, may have
been the spot intended. But there must have been other VAR·EYS;
place-names beginning with VAR were common. Perhaps there was a
VAR·EY near Delst, or in Helsingland, all which country, as we know,
swarms with lakes a·nd ilands.

Note-book but from a loose pen-and·ink drawing by him, from which he
intended to make a fair copy for· publication. He has a runic translitera·

out the inscription in Roman characters, thus:
