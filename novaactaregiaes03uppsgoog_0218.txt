6 G. Smpunns,

As I have said again and again, so far from one »Grammam or

»Wordbookn in one great land-group for 1000 winters, every indepen-
dent document or monument from the old uncentralized times has in a

certain sense and to a certain degree in every country its own Grammar
and its own Wordbook, with endless transitional forms and meanings and
-pronominal twists or survivals in the changing local dialeets3 — for no
caprice is so capricious as the caprice of language, as long as it lives,
is not bound down by centra] violence, or has not become a venerable
mummy ¹).

The first printed Swedish book therefore, seen in this light, cannot
but be most instructive. Written by a learned ecclesiastic under Archi-
episcopal protection‚ — does it give us »fixt forms», uniform spellings,
»orthodon grammar, regular syntax, and all such things? — Nothing of
the sort. Viewed with pedantical eyeS, it is »confusion worse confounded».
But taken practically it is exactly what we should expect, an edifying
treatise well given in the Book-Swedish of the day, with archaisms and

¹) England‚ America and France have never bowed their necks; and even in
Germany, the home of the arrogance and »iron lawa» and »national unity of language»‚
which have hampered and damagcd so greatly what is called »Modern Philology» —
8 great reaction has set in, and this in many directions. It took 8 long time to get
rid of the slavery under »Mense-Gothic», as is the bits in the VVulfilaffleriptorium (and
even they show various grammatical variationis, some of them sillem) exhausted all
the scattered Gothic dialects. People at last now also rebel against being shut up in
the copper box called »Sanscritm The claim of the local folk-talk is now being
distinctly aeknowledged. 1 will give one of the latest examples:

»Der schreiber der Leidener handschrift von Willirams paraphrase des Hohen
liedes ist so zu sagen ein Berliner. Er verwechselt in seiner sprache mir und mih und
ffihlt sich darin so sicher dass er die falechen formen gegen die richtigen seiner vorlage
einsetzt ......... Der schreiber der Leidener hs. gehorte demnach einer gegend
an, in welcher dat. und aee. der personalpronomina in den formen mi und tbi zusam-
men fielen». —— Schera, Schrvflsprache des elften Jahrhunderts; Zm‘tschr. f. deutsches
Alter-ahma. Βᾱ. 22, svo. Berlin 1878, p. 321.

Ten or twenty years age, all this common sense and matter-of·fact would have
been impossible. Hence all such linguistic illegalities were ›correcteds and »normal-
ized»‚ and therefore are most German editions of olden writers -- wastepaper. And
even later and the latest foreign and Scandinavian editions of Icelmtdic Poems and
Sagas are commonly more or less wastepaper, as far as philology is concerned. They
are usually careless and incorrect; exceptional words and forms are often destroyed,
or put into an illegible small-type note; and frequently the whole text is »normal-
ized»‚ or· else it is screwed back to »the correct Saga-style», so that every trace of
each century on the language altogether disappears, and we thus get the boasted
»unchanging Icelandic». But the world is governed by humbug.
