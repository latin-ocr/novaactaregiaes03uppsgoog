the Legend of S. Veronica (Miillers Collectanea Anglo-Saxonica, 8*⁰.
Havniae 1835, p. 16, 1. 31), »be pam Haelende obbon be hys leorning-
cnyhtum». —- And in the S. Engl. Gospels (for instance in S. Matthew
111 Anglo-Saxon and Northumbrian Versions, synoptically arranged. Cam·
bridge 1858, 42⁰), we have in the older S. E. codex, S. Mat. 5, 36,
ODDE, but in the later ODERNE and comm.- Many more examples
could be added, but these are sufficient. The curious ODERNE above

is in fact a double comparative. We can take the -ER form of ODDE =

ODDER, or the -N form, ODDEN, ODDON. Botlz together will give us
OnER-NE. These English instances show local dialects following the N

type when making an emphatic comparative. In Germany the word went
another way. At the close of the Ohg. period there creeps in an em-
phatic comparative, and it rapidly spreads in the Mid. Hg till it becomes
»orthodoxn in the Mod. Germ, —— but it takes the R ending, and thus
becomes ODAR, ODIR, the mod. German ODER.

Another English word, OFT, has gone the same way. It was
often used as an emphatic comparat-ive, and became OF TER, but also
took the N shape as OFTEN. This OFTEN has now become a new
positive, alike in meaning to the older OFT, and we now nse it 39 311
Adj. and Adv„ OFTEN, OFTENER, OFTENEST, — just as some of
our forefathers had said ODERNE.

Minute enquiries in other directions and other tungs may bring
fresh prooss of this -AN among the Scando-Gothic tribes. But enough
has been collected to show that this development must rest on older
usa-qe. And the best key to this older usage is the Sanscrit-group, which
has 2 comparative forms, both which (especially the -R) have left their
marks in all our Aryan talks. The usual Sanscrit degree-couple, scarae
in Europe, is -TARA, sup. -TARA(S>‚ -TA’, ’-MA. The other and rarer,
'but general in Europe, is that in -IYANS, -YANS, or (N nasalized)
-IYAS, -YAS‚ sup. -ISTA, -STA, The N remaining sharp and the S
(weakened to R) falling away, we get the comparative in -AN, But the
N may be nasalized and drop out, giving us -IYAS, -ISTA, The best
account of all this in simple language is in Bopp's ¹) Vergleichende
Grammatik, 8'0. 2¹²⁶ ed., Berlin. At p. 32 and fol. of Vol. 2, Berlin

¹) In my opinion Bopp would have been only too glad to add these interesting
Scando-Anglic examples of -AN, in confirmation of his reasoning‚ — if he had been

awarc of them.
