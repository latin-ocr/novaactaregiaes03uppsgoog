4'0 O. sm: Am) G. S‘rsrnssss,

is a mistake, that the piece is Cla-ri «tiam. Hence my translation in many
places falls away of itself, and Buocn's takes its place.

For in Sept. 1877 appeared Buoos’ s 4to .essay¹) on this 1ron roundle‚
with a separate facsimile of the runes drawn and lithographt full size
by Mr. C. F. Lmnnssno. The first key to the whole more mysterious
Section was my identification of the word LIUbRIT(1). The next was
Prof.O1.A1·* chu’s excellent idea that AKU could only be = AGU, own,
have. The third was Prof. Buocss’s admirable LIRbIR, thus stamping the
whole as Christian and enabling him so to use his great learning and
ingenuity as substantially to solve this difficult problem. In this he was
also assisted by the accident of his being a Norwegian, for his philolo-
gical instinct has recognized in certain things in the risting traces of
Old-Norse peculiarities, explained by the fact, also pointed out by Ruunt,
that the folk-speech of olden Helsingland had some features in common
with Old-Norse. Thus, on the whole, his version is in my opinion tri·
umphantly happy and probable. Hard points will always remaint-and Ι
differ from him as to some words; but in general we must, I believe,
undoubtedly follow him in his construction and translation. All honor
to him for this his latest and ripest gift to Northern linguistic science!

CARI. SAVE made his drawings on the 4th and 5th of Sept. 1851.
They were engraved by me in my work. He himself never attempted
or publisht any translation. I therefore here repeat my 2 engravings of
the Ring, bnt Ι have had the runes CORRECTED according] to tlze copy
,qiven us by Buce-1³2²). I add my own neu· version, chiefly based, as I shall
shOW, upon Bueoss's, where he differs from my former text (for in some
things we os course all agree), but offering some changes, perhaps recti·
fications, of his reading. — Otherwise, for further details, I refer to my
vol. 2 p. 684, and to Busan-:s exhaustive paper.

As we see, following Buoou's corrected text, the runes are:

ι) »Rune-lndskriften paa Ringen i Forsa Kirke i Nordre Helsingland». Chri-
stiania 1877. 58 pages, with plate.

²) On these 2 blocks the runes (like as the Ring itself) are only 2·thirds of
the full sizo, and they are sometimes more stiff than in Bucon’s lithograph, to which
therefore, in this respect, I refer for minutiae.
