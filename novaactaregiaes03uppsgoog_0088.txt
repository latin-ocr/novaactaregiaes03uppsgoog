30 C. Silva Ano G. Swpnexs,

minue-stone, tho such would only cost some peuce and a couple of hours'
work, — and the transcript by Eonm, in Limssossn is simply useless.

Hence the above drawing, however imperfect as merely a first
attempt by a non-artistic hand, is of the greatest value to us. It even
renders possible the thought- that the epigraph may be redd and the
lacune reasonably filled up.

Sava tells us in ‚his Note-book that this piece was very much
worn, and was covered with figures of men and animals and birds, which
he was incapable of representing ¹). He has, however, given us a man
driving a cart, and 2 men playing at some table-game while a third is
otherwise employed. I only-hope that it may not be impossible for us
still to recover the interesting figure-details of this sculptured slab!

Its greatest height, Silvi: says, was about 7 feet 8 inches, its
greatest breadth about 4 feet. It stood in the chamber behind the altar¹).

But Ι can find among SAvss papers no single word about this
monolith, no attempt to translate it or grapple with its difficulties. We
have therefore not the benefit of his guidance. But he has put-in the
runes so carefully, that we may perhaps look upon them as substantially
correct.

As a preliminary step we must see and acknowledge that the
formula is here very uncommon, and that the words must be handled
accordingly. Next, as to the staveS, we must remark that we have here
2 characters for S, the k, and the ¹, and that >k (only found once) is ap-
parent-ly used here with its olden value as AE, of which we have such
multitudinous exampleS.

I would begin at the head of the worm-wind, and divide and
translate as follows:

Thus, should the above be on the whole rightly understood, this
monument to SUART-HAUF 1³1, or whatever the broken name ending in
