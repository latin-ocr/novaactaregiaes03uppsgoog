humanu, who also used a copy by CELsms, has: Tvari. riti stin
pino at Kupbiurn brupur sin . . . —- . . . kuni var mupiss 2. Kupmuntar .
Kupmuntr pruknapi:

All that we have from Skvu’s hand is the above loose pehcil·sketch,
very rough, made on the l3th of Sept. 1851. He then measured the
stone. It was about 7 feet high by about 3 feet 3 inches broad.

All the old copies being so faulty, and SAvn not having left one
line of help, what are we to do? We may at all events remark that the
old transcribere quietly foryed the UAR in KUl’A UAR MUbIR‚ because
it appeared necessary that the word vzust be UAR. Secondly, we may
as well try to read so much of the risting as is decently legible, about
one half of the whole. If the good men of old had only taken a couple
os paper casts of each stone (cost, some ores), we should now be able
to decipher most of the old blocks now partly illegible or altogether lost.
People gave and give what they saw or see, often things extravagant
enough. Only the cast can control the eye of the copyist. Where the
letters are so worn and weak that we can get no useful impression, then
and only then can the cast be dispenst with.

We observe, then, that there are 2 marks for S, Η and 1. — Next,
in a long inscription we must have a nominative, a verb and an accusa-
tive. Here the accusative, STIN blNO, is plain. The first word is there-

fore the nominative, and the verb must be between. But what was the

· first word? I do not know, All the transcripte are confused. Is the mark

at the extreme left a beginning-sign, a cross or something such, or is it
a rune? The next letters seem to be TRIUI, possibly a name compounded
with ΤΗΙ (ΤΒᾸ). If not, adding the first mark, the name was perhaps

ATRIUI. — The next group must be the verb, perhaps originally RISI
(= RISTI) raised, or RITI, wrote. — The AT KUlJBIURNA seems clear.

But, is s0, KUbBIURNA is an antique accusative. — Then BRUITRSII
or BURITRSII, but more probably BRUbUR sm, as in Lamum-m. -
Some runes follow, of which I can make nothing. They would seem to
speak os KUbBIURN as being something I MANAIM, apparently a place-
name. There was a MANSHEIMS-HERAD, and therefore a MAN or

MANS HAIM, in Norway, and there may have been a MANHAIM else-
where. — The rest of the line seems to me ruined and meaningless.

Now the line belom The UAR in Bautil is not on the stone.
Bautil has KUNI UAR MUpIR, Bm KUNA, UA MUlJIR, siva KUTI
UA MUbIR. But no KUNI οι· KUNA or KUTI has been spoken of be-

fore, and there is no divisional mark between UA and M.. It would seem,
