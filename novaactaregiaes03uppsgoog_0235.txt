we see, this is only a cursory remark and is very unsatisfactory3 for
this N has both had a »varaktig stad» of old, and keeps it to this day.

The older Swedish Chanoery-dialeet, in harmony with many —
perhaps most — of the land-talks, as we all knOW, preferred the com-
moner Comparative in -ARE, and Ms. examples of the -ANE only go
back to the 142⁸ century - only about 50 years later than the oldest
Swedish codices we have. But this is of course no proof whatever that
in certain Swedish dialeots this N may not have been as old as the form
in R. And this is the more likely as it is no novelty, but a widely
spread and independent form. It is at tlzis moment in full nse

1, in Skane‚ South Sweden, in the little neck of land where we
have Skanor and F alsterb03

2, in Midland Sweden, in Varend and other parts of Smaland3

3, in Norra Angermanland, N. of Sweden, where we have such
things as: go, goENE, goest (good, gooder = better, goodest = best);
vakker (handsome, fine), vakkrENE‚ vakkrest; moken (weary, sleepy,
heavy), mokENE, (mokest); tong (heavy), tyngENE, tyngest‚ eto. etc.

4. But it is also well known in the Finno-Swedz'sh talks. In Prof.
A. O. Frendenthal's »Bidrag till Ordbok osver Narpesmalet», in the S. W.
of Osterbotten, (Helsingfors 1878, 810), Ι find, as the Comparative of
DOGGLI (duglig, tjanlig, god), VALKAN‚ sup. valkast. See Rietz‚ Lex.
11. VALKER (comp. valkare, sup. valkast). But besides the positive
forms ‘Valker, Valker and Valkr, Rietz has also VALKJEN(Gestrik1and)
and VALKEN Westmanland) as positives, probably a mere error for
comparative. — So again under »dalin (dowly, bad) Frendenthal has
compar. NAGGAN or »sambern, sup. »naggastn' or »samst)), with the
example: »tjuvin je naggan an ar, men all naggast je fanin». Rietz
translates this (under NAGG), »Tjusven {ir daligare {in andra, men allra
uslast ar djefvulen» = the thies: is worse them others, but worst of all .
is the devil. Freudenthal adds (U. NAGGANJ, that the positive, NAGG‚
in Helsingland means weak, miserable3 in Vesterbotten‚ miserly, mean;
in Upland, searoe, rare, short. — So under SIRI, busy, industriouS,
Frendenthal gives the exan1ple; Han e SIRIAN ἂι) ar, men int je an
sma = Han ar arbetsammare {in andra, men ioke girig (pinching, miserly).
