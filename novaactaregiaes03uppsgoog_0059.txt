In the autumn of 1851, chiefly in August and September, my learned
and lamented friend Prof. Dr. CARL Silva made an antiquarian excursion to
examine the so·called Helsing-stones and other forn-laves in Northern
Sweden. He took careful but rough copieS, and it was always his in·
tention to draw these out fairly and make them public. He had parti-
cularly entrusted to me, from time to time, some! of his ideas thereon.
But alasl, his frequent attacks of illness prevented him from carrying
out his plan, and at last he was called away from us, 27 March 1876.

1 have therefore thought it my duty, in honor to his memory, to
endeavor to make known, in his name, what he has left on this head.
I give his -own words, where we have any. Otherwise, I have made
remarks of my own. Copies taken 25 years agO, when the stones had
necessarily suffered less than they have nOW, must always be most va-
luable. Also very interesting is the new soundpower‚ which Prof. SAvE
has given to the rune ² , namely H, instead of S, the value formerly given
to it. This new identification, whether correct or no, is at least much
more so than the older one. The distinguisht Norwegian rune-lorist
Prof. Dr. Somne Bucen has lately examined these stones afresh, and
intends publishing his remarks thereon. We shall welcome them. Whether
these two great linguists agree or not in every detail, it will be most
instructive to have the ideas of each. Science will be advanced by the
labors of both.

All the Ms. materials relating to this subject which could be found
among Prof. SAvE's papers, now by gift of his brother Dr. P. A. Sive
the property of the Library in Upsala, have been kindly forwarded to
me; but they consist only of a little Note-book, some loose sheets and
sketches, and drawings of 3 stones more or less ready for engraving.
Whatever could be given in facsimile Ι now lay before the reader, Pho·
toxylographt by J. F. RosssnsrA·ND of Cheapinghaven (Kjobenhavn). The
expense of these blocks has been generously⁴ borne hy the Royal Society
of Sciences in Upsala, of which Prof. SAvn was so distinguisht a member.
